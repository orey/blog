## The winning couple for a RPG starting now with no preparation?

I analyzed extensively the [Risus](http://www.risusiverse.com) RPG (which is short so that did not take much time) and created a [flowchart](https://github.com/orey/jdr/tree/master/Risus-fr) to sum-up this micro-game (in French). Yes, my intention is to translate stuff when I can and when the license enables it.

In order to play without any preparation, not at the game mechanics level, not at the scenario level, maybe the winning couple is **[Risus](http://www.risusiverse.com) + [Mythic](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator)**.

Risus is a funny game with very simple game mechanics, that are similar to some other mini-RPGs such as Cthulhu Dark ([French version](https://orey.github.io/cthulhu-dark-fr)) or the children game FirstFable ([French version](https://orey.github.io/premierefable)) or even the very micro-game Roll for Shoes ([French version](https://github.com/orey/jdr/tree/master/RollForShoes-fr)).

I think the emergence of mini-RPGs is the proof of the aging of some RPG players. When you are young, you are keen to work hard in very large rule books. When you are older, you can run on the accumulated capacities of coming from the years of playing and you are more confident on your GM talents.

The problem of older players is the availability of other players. When everyone has its life, it's not so easy to meet. So, quite often, the sessions are scarcer, and with less players (unless you enroll your children). For that, simple game engines can be a good way to address the rule part preparation. Remains the adventure itself for which you can use many tools: generators or even GM emulators.

Concerning GM emulation, I think it would be great to use it inside a pre-existing universe. I have to investigate on that.

## A very creative period

It's been a long time since I did not have a look to the RPG world, almost 25 years! For sure, I discovered that a multitude of RPGs and RPG engines were created in 25 years, and some of them seem to me as particularly notable.

One of them is [Mythic GM Emulator](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator). This engine defined a new way to envisage to RPG by playing adventures with a level of randomness and possibly with no GM. I will write more about that game soon. I must admit that, a long time ago, I know many players that would have been greatly satisfied with that kind of engine.

This creative period is very interesting because, for the RPG player and GM, there are plenty of offers, and most of them quite affordable. Many are Creative Commons or open source, or free. There is also the dominant position of [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/) as a global dealer of RPGs.

I can see many great evolutions in the RPG universe in those last years :

* The development of Internet enabled many independant authors to create very interesting material, very often for a limited price.
* The development of print on demand enabled also to differentiate the selling of PDFs from the selling of printed manuals, which is great, considering the disappearance of many gaming shops (at least in France).
* The SRD 3.5 opened the door to re-interpretations of old school ways of playing RPGs.

On this topic, I started reading the blog of James Maliszewski,  [Grogniardia](https://grognardia.blogspot.com). It is very intesting and enables me to catch on with the RPG world. There are some good moments, in this blog, about the old school RPG gaming, mostly based on the the 2 first editions of D&D. Even if I was never a player of D&D, the old school is talking to me. The age, maybe. The passion for CoC also.

The fact is, the period from 2000 to 2010 seems very creative, whereas I am not so sure that the following decade was (the one that is terminating now). I have to investigate.

In some dimensions, I understand old school fanatics to be sad that things changed. But on the other hand, we still have many choices in the offer, so much actually that searching the product that corresponds to you can be long. But I think we should not complain. It is just a new era of RPG with several generations playing the same kind of games and so expecting different things from it.

For sure, everyone is not paying a single "master" game, but, withour being a specialist, when I see all the supplements produced by Paizo on PathFinder, I wonder if most players are not still concentrated on heroic-fantasy games around the D&D rules (being 3rd edition or another).
