Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p> <p>This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p> <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#1-applicability-and-definitions","title":"1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS","text":"<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.</p> <p>A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</p> <p>A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p> <p>The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</p> <p>The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p> <p>A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".</p> <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p> <p>The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p> <p>The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.</p> <p>A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.</p> <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#2-verbatim-copying","title":"2.

COPYING IN QUANTITY","text":"<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p> <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p> <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</p> <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#4-modifications","title":"4.

In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p> <p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</p> <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p> <p>You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p> <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.

There seem to be a way to open comments in this blog but I am not sure many people will be interested by the topic. If you are, contact me by mail.</p> <p>A long time ago, I played RPGs, mainly CoC, Warhammer, Parano\u00efa, Vampire, Kult, but also French games like Mega II, Bitume, Empire et Dynasties ou L\u00e9gendes. I was never a player of D&amp;D.</p> <p>Recently, I have entered the RPG world again and try to catch up, especially with all the SRD and Open Gaming adventure. That initiative created PathFinder as a competitor to D&amp;D. I'm reading some other rule books inheritated from the SRD 3.5, especially Basic Fantasy RPG, and OSRIC.</p> <p>Indeed, as I like the D20 system in general, I would like to inspire the Enterprise RPG gaming system from it.</p> <p>The fact is I find it very surprising that there seem to be no dodge or parrying system. In a round (let's says 10 seconds), I would have expected every PC to have at least 1 attack and 1 defense. For sure, the order in the combat sequence is depending upon initiative, which means that if you don't have the initiative, you can try to parry (with your shield or your weapon - BTW, weapon parrying power depends on the weapon because a stick is not a sword) or to dodge.</p> <p>Dodging should be the result of DEX and so have some bonus/malus coming from DEX and some bonus/malus coming from AC (it is more complex to dodge with a plate armor than without).</p> <p>Concerning parrying, it could be done at the same level that the attack, or to be some kind of contest versus the attack of the attacker. However, you should choose to parry with your shield or your weapon.</p> <p>For sure, I think the AC concept theoretically takes into account this fact, but I think it breaks the balance in combat. Let us suppose you are a Monk at level 12: You should be unreachable my most creatures, even if you don't attack and you just dodge.</p> <p>The fact of having 2 attacks per round would give you the same number of defenses. I even think you should be able to turn the attack in a defense if you need it, for instance when attacked by multiple enemies.</p> <p>I have to continue my investigations to see how dodge and parrying are treated in other rule books. I am not really in favor of dodging being a skill: it should be more part of the core combat system.</p> <p>I have to reply on a logical combat system that's why those investigations are interesting.</p> <p>August 30</p>","tags":["D&D","Call of Cthulhu","Paranoia","Vampire","Kult","Mega","Bitume","Mal\u00e9fices","Empires & Dynasties","L\u00e9gendes","Basic Fantasy RPG","OSRIC","D20 System","D6 System","Jung"]},{"location":"blog/202008/#spells-classes-and-armor-class","title":"Spells, classes and armor class","text":"<p>Courtesys of sirdrak</p> <p>Spells</p> <p>Some enterprise PCs have Charism but not only.

Low skills should provide a malus for saving throws.</p> <p>Anyway, the seduction should be considered as a magic power.</p> <p>Magic could be based on Charisma.</p> <p>Classes of characters</p> <p>Indeed, as all PCs are human (are they really? ;), there are no races.

Sandra is a woman and she has an argument with Vincent, a man. Vincent is \"Feel\" oriented whereas Sandra is more \"Think\".

In France, we have a long lasting past and everyone at school studies the Middle-Age, and the Greeks and Romans before that. In a certain way, a \"dungeon\" is just the biggest tower in a castle, where the lord used to live.</p> <p>Chivalry, in the French unconscious, is quite different than the picture that is depicted in D&amp;D: knights have a law code and serve the widow and the orphan. They are often in love with a lady in a romantic way. They may face magic but not in the D&amp;D sense. In a way, the Arthurian legend remains our reference.</p> <p>For a European eye, D&amp;D looks like a western in tunnels with monsters as enemies, instead of Indians. I know, this is a bit provocative, but D&amp;D is not at all a vision of chivalry, as we have traditionally in France. On the contrary: killing monsters, conquer territories and gain treasures to gain levels look, to me, as a caricature of the American dream.</p>    D&amp;D element Element of American culture French traditional chivalry element Element of French culture     Travel in the wilderness to conquer territories This really seems as the ideal of the Far West, which is typical American culture In French, chivalry, knight quests are for God or for a loved one. Conquering  territories is no more considered as a positive thing (colonization is seen as a bad thing)   Fight enemies and kill monsters The violence is part of American culture, as the fighting The notion of \"monster\" is present in the European legends but in small doses, probably due to Catholicism Violence is more psychological and verbal than real in French society (maybe because it is forbidden to have weapons)   Gain treasure Typical American culture about earthly wealth, which is also typical from protestant countries The knights were fighting for an ideal and not for money, especially money coming from the murder and robbery of other living beings Catholic tradition that sees money as something dirty   Gain experience and progress in the levels This can be seen as a real appetite for social ascension, and social competition This appetite also exists but not really in the chivalry tradition Social progression was also a feature of the Baby Boomers, being in the US or in Europe    <p>In other words, D&amp;D is a very American game: A universe where violence and murder enables to progress in the society and become more powerful...</p> <p>Maybe that deserves more details than this quick simplistic psycho-analysis, but that may also explain why, for many French people, D&amp;D is not very exciting.</p> <p>In France, we have this expression \"Gros Bill\" (\"Big Bill\") who is supposed to represent the super-hero knight, able to massacre everyone. If I saw many Gros-Bills, I never saw them craving for wilderness. Because we are old countries, most of us don't dream about conquest of the wild countries.</p> <p>For sure, D&amp;D can be played like CoC, with more atmosphere and monsters that are so powerful that your should run instead of fighting.</p> <p>But, discovering progressively the roots of D&amp;D, I think I progress in my understanding of why D&amp;D is not my cup of tea.</p> <p>September 15 2020</p>","tags":["Mythic","Mahler","D&D","Mkdocs","Github","SRD","Grogniardia","Simulacres","Risus","Cthulhu Dark"]},{"location":"blog/202009/#software-help-for-rpgs","title":"Software help for RPGs?","text":"<p>For sure, dice are crucial to RPGs.

The game system could have been innovative, but instead it is complicated and even a bit pretentious. I really dislike this feature in French personality: bragging as if French people had invented the hot water (French expression). Nevertheless, I love France and the French.

I would say that Croc is probably one of a kind, that did not, or at least I don't remember. Maybe also the one who created the French RPG where you play lycanthropes.

When you are young, you are keen to work hard in very large rule books. When you are older, you can run on the accumulated capacities of GM-ing that you have accumulated for so many years.</p> <p>The problem of older players is, for sure, the availability of other players. When everyone has its life, it's not so easy to meet. So, quite often, the sessions are scarcer, and with less players (unless you enroll your own children).

This engine defined a new way to envisage to RPG by playing adventures with a level of randomness and possibly with no GM. I will write more about that game soon. I must admit that, a long time ago, I know many players that would have been greatly satisfied with that kind of engine.</p> <p>This creative period is very interesting because, for the RPG player and GM, there are plenty of offers, and most of them quite affordable.

It is very intesting and enables me to catch on with the RPG world. There are some good moments, in this blog, about the old school RPG gaming, mostly based on the the 2 first editions of D&amp;D (OD&amp;D and Holmes mainly). Even if I was never a player of D&amp;D, the old school is talking to me. The age, maybe. The passion for CoC also where I find the same kind of objectives: play with not so many rules, have fun, and improvise. Maybe we are not so far from each other after all.</p> <p>The fact is, the period from 2000 to 2010 seems very creative, whereas I am not so sure that the following decade was (the one that is terminating now). I have to investigate.</p> <p>In some dimensions, I understand old school fanatics to be sad that things changed. But on the other hand, we still have many choices in the offer, so much actually that searching for the product that corresponds to you can be quite long. But I think we should not complain. It is just a new era of RPG with several generations playing the same kind of games and so expecting different things from it.</p> <p>For sure, everyone is not playing a single \"universal\" game, but, without being a specialist, when I see all the supplements produced by Paizo on PathFinder, I wonder if most players are not still concentrated on heroic-fantasy games around the D&amp;D rules (being 3rd edition or another).</p> <p>September 7 2020</p>","tags":["Mythic","Mahler","D&D","Mkdocs","Github","SRD","Grogniardia","Simulacres","Risus","Cthulhu Dark"]},{"location":"blog/202111/","title":"November 2021","text":"","tags":["Wagner","Nibelung","Anneau","Seigneur des anneaux","Tolkien","Gandalf","D&D","Dragon"]},{"location":"blog/202111/#gandalf-un-magicien-niveau-5-dans-un-mauvais-scenar-de-dd","title":"Gandalf, un magicien niveau 5 dans un mauvais sc\u00e9nar de D&amp;D","text":"<p>En recherchant des trucs dans les vieux Dragon, j'ai trouv\u00e9 cet article provoquant de 1977 comme quoi Gandalf \u00e9tait un vulgaire magicien niveau 5.</p> <p>Cela m'a bien fait rire car je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 un grand fan du Seigneur des Anneaux.

J'ai rat\u00e9 plus de 20 ans de l'histoire du hobby, j'ai donn\u00e9 quelques unes de mes reliques de JDR \u00e0 mon fr\u00e8re voil\u00e0 des ann\u00e9es (dont une bo\u00eete de D&amp;D rouge 1e en fran\u00e7ais presque neuve !), c'est normal que je veuille combler mes lacunes avec des vieux trucs. Le probl\u00e8me, c'est que, ces vieilleries ne sont pas simples \u00e0 trouver et, quand on les trouve, elles sont souvent ch\u00e8res.</p> <p>Ces derniers temps, j'ai acquis pour quelques euros les 3 volumes de D&amp;D 3.5 en \u00e9tat correct \u00e0 bon. A l'\u00e9tranger.</p> <p>J'ai aussi trouv\u00e9 M\u00e9ga 3 en \u00e9dition Descartes, \u00e9dition compl\u00e8tement scandaleuse (reprise avec les fautes du num\u00e9ro sp\u00e9cial de Casus avec une intro focalis\u00e9e sur les errata), mais acquise pour le sc\u00e9nario.</p>  <p>J'ai aussi laiss\u00e9 dans mon pass\u00e9, une premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition fran\u00e7aise de Star Wars D6 WEG et le sourcebook qui allait avec. J'ai d\u00fb retravailler un peu les PDF qui se trouvent tr\u00e8s facilement, WEG ayant cess\u00e9 d'exister et je me suis fait une petite commande Lulu, le premier en cartonn\u00e9 super couleurs (un vrai fac-simil\u00e9 de l'\u00e9dition originale US) et le second en cartonn\u00e9 N&amp;B, respectivement 28\u20ac et 10\u20ac. Je lisais l'autre fois dans le mail de Black Book que le papier devient cher, mais de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 je dois dire que je n'ai pas vu la diff\u00e9rence. Un fac-simil\u00e9 1e cartonn\u00e9 couleur pour moins de 30\u20ac, en France, c'est du jamais vu.</p> <p>J'ai pas mal utilis\u00e9 Lulu pour des livres, notamment des 18\u00e8me et 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cles, et franchement, c'est imbattable, que ce soit au niveau qualit\u00e9 ou au niveau prix. En plus, vous avez une \u00e9dition unique et c'est fait en France, d'o\u00f9 un d\u00e9lai moyen de deux semaines pour avoir les ouvrages.</p> <p>Raahah (r\u00e2le du grognard), je suis content ! Star Wars D6 est une \u00e9tape de plus dans mon exploration grognardesque des syst\u00e8mes de jeu D6, apr\u00e8s Risus et Ghostbusters.</p> <p>D'ailleurs, demain, je re\u00e7ois Ghostbusters 1e et 2e (international edition) avec tous les suppl\u00e9ments WEG en provenance directe de l'imprimeur fran\u00e7ais qui bosse pour Lulu !

Ce livre est un jalon important dans l'analyse des contes de f\u00e9es dans la mesure o\u00f9 il prend le sujet par la structure des contes, et montre que, bien qu'en apparence tr\u00e8s nombreux et divers, tous les contes analys\u00e9s ob\u00e9issent \u00e0 une m\u00eame \"\u00e9quation\".</p> <p>Des ann\u00e9es plus tard, ayant d\u00e9couvert la Grande Liste, j'ai eu l'impression que John Ross red\u00e9couvrait ce m\u00eame concept. Sans aller jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9quation, ce dernier propose une liste d'intrigues, des variations et des possibles retournements, qui font que la plupart des intrigues de sc\u00e9narios semblent entrer dans ces quelques pages.</p> <p>Il fournit aussi un conseil trivial, mais \u00e0 ne pas oublier : dans les JDRs, l'intrigue est souvent simple ; ce sont les personnages qui la rendent attirante. L'intrigue n'est rien sans les r\u00f4les, ceux des PJs mais aussi ceux des PNJs qui donnent une couleur particuli\u00e8re.</p> <p>Je ne pense pas qu'il existait une version traduite avant celle que j'ai mis en ligne.

J'avais commenc\u00e9 sur le syst\u00e8me D6 ici : https://github.com/orey/jdr/tree/master/D6-System</p> <p>Je me souviens que j'avais beaucoup aim\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me de Star Wars avant de d\u00e9couvrir que des diff\u00e9rences de nombres de d\u00e9s \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s difficiles \u00e0 compenser.</p> <p>R\u00e9cemment, je me suis remis \u00e0 fond dans Risus et l\u00e0 encore, le syst\u00e8me Risus, surtout en mode combat, Clich\u00e9 contre Chich\u00e9, avec chaque clich\u00e9 ayant un certain nombre de d6, m'a fait me poser de grandes questions.</p> <p>Je suis revenu \u00e0 la source en analysant Ghostbusters (en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement gratuit sur le lien). Le syst\u00e8me est le m\u00eame, sans doute plus flexible que le syst\u00e8me Risus (j'y reviendrai).</p> <p>Je me suis dit que, vraisemblablement, des gens avaient d\u00fb travailler les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s d'un combat de 3d6 contre 4d6, par exemple. Je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9, si bien que j'ai fait un petit tableur et un petit programme pour pouvoir le calculer. Les r\u00e9sultats sont l\u00e0 :</p>  <p>On voit bien sur ces deux tableaux l'ampleur des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. D\u00e8s que les deux combattants ont un d6 d'\u00e9cart, les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s chutent.</p> <p>Dans Risus, ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne peut \u00eatre compens\u00e9 par la Gonflette, mais cette derni\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteuse car, si elle permet de booster sur un round (il faut l'envisager dans un combat o\u00f9 l'on se sert de plusieurs Clich\u00e9s), le co\u00fbt ensuite de -1d6 est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s violent.</p> <p>Dans Ghostbusters, c'est plus malin, je trouve : on prend un bon point qui devient un d6 suppl\u00e9mentaire, histoire d'\u00eatre plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Et comme les PJs ont normalement plein de bons points, on peut en consommer quelques uns durant un combat.</p> <p>De m\u00e9moire, dans Star Wars, il y a aussi un moyen de \"booster\" pour compenser provisoirement le d\u00e9calage sur une action.

Le jeu doit \u00eatre un jeu de r\u00f4les m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique</p> <p>Cela reste DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, et nous devons rester fid\u00e8les \u00e0 nos racines.</p> <p>2.

Une exp\u00e9rience de jeu coop\u00e9ratif</p> <p>De m\u00eame, nous voulons maintenir l'aspect coop\u00e9ratif et \u00e9quipe des groupes d'aventuriers.</p> <p>4. M\u00e9caniques de base</p> <p>Il faut garder le d20, les jets \u00e9lev\u00e9s indiquant un bon r\u00e9sultat, les classes, les niveaux, et les races fantastiques. Il faut que le jeu reste unifi\u00e9 et solide dans ses m\u00e9caniques, et il faut suivre cette voie dans tous ses aspects.</p> <p>5. Des tactiques tridimensionnelles</p> <p>Nous voulons continuer d'utiliser des figurines localis\u00e9es dans des carr\u00e9s de 1.5 m\u00e8tre (\"5-foot squares\"). Nous voulons concevoir des mini-jeux (escarmouche) pour fonctionner avec le JDR. Nous en reparlerons prochainement.</p> <p>6. Des options et non pas des restrictions</p> <p>Nous voulons maintenir cette philosophie dans la nouvelle \u00e9dition, m\u00eame si nous entrevoyons des endroits dans le jeu o\u00f9 nous voudrions mettre en place quelques restrictions pour l'\u00e9quilibre du jeu.</p> <p>7. Am\u00e9liorer le jeu</p> <p>Pour bien pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle \u00e9dition au public, nous devons cr\u00e9er un meilleur jeu, plus rapide et plus robuste. Les am\u00e9liorations devraient inclure quelque chose de cool \u00e0 chaque niveau, plus de place \u00e0 la conception pour les options des personnages (mais attention \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9), un meilleur m\u00e9lange de m\u00e9caniques (\"crunch\") et d'histoire ou d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de roleplay (\"fluff\"). Supprimer les r\u00e8gles, les sorts et les sous-syst\u00e8mes probl\u00e9matiques.</p> <p>8. Faire un jeu facile \u00e0 concevoir, \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper, \u00e0 \u00e9diter</p> <p>D&amp;D 3.0/3.5 est un monstre dans lequel il est tr\u00e8s difficile de construire, depuis les blocs de statistiques jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9quilibre des rencontres.

Les jeux qui complexifient le syst\u00e8me et le verrouillent rendent complexes toutes les \u00e9volutions.</p> <p>\u00c9videmment, les am\u00e9ricains y voient un probl\u00e8me financier, mais le probl\u00e8me est, comme le dit Slavicsek, avant tout un probl\u00e8me de conception. Si je voulais \u00eatre ironique, je dirais que le point 8 pourrait se r\u00e9sumer \u00e0 : comment D&amp;D 4 devient aussi souple que GURPS Core System ?</p> <p>Une des premi\u00e8res choses que l'on apprend dans le Races &amp; Classes, c'est que le d\u00e9fi est relev\u00e9 au travers des sources de pouvoirs (\"power sources\"). Dans la mesure o\u00f9 chaque classe peut tirer de sa propre source de pouvoir ses pouvoirs, le syst\u00e8me remplit sa promesse de pouvoir \u00eatre extensible \u00e0 l'infini : les sources de pouvoirs \"g\u00e9n\u00e8rent\" des diff\u00e9rentes classes (et il sera donc possible d'en cr\u00e9er de nouvelles dans le futur).</p> <p>Il reste toujours possible de sp\u00e9cialiser \"en profondeur\" les classes, mais \"verticalement, sans impacter les autres classes, car n'ayant pas la m\u00eame source de pouvoirs, elles ne sont pas \"en collision\" ou en risque d'incoh\u00e9rence.</p> <p>Bien s\u00fbr, cela implique que le guerrier a une structure de pouvoirs qui est la m\u00eame que celle des magiciens et aux clercs, m\u00eame si son pouvoir est \"martial\", alors que les autres sont respectivement \"arcanes\" ou \"divins\". Ainsi, une source de pouvoirs \"psionic\" est envisageable \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des autres (cf. Player's Guide volume 2). A chacun sa source de pouvoirs !</p> <p>Ce choix de conception a de multiples avantages :</p> <ul> <li>Chaque niveau de personnage peut \u00eatre \"tun\u00e9\" aux petits oignons, et donc \u00eatre \"cool \u00e0 passer (besoin num\u00e9ro 7 de Slavicsek).</li> <li>Comme l'\u00e9chelle de tous les pouvoirs est absolue (en gros chaque pouvoir est d\u00e9crit de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on sur une \u00e9chelle universelle), les diff\u00e9rentes classes de personnages sont comparables en puissance !</li> <li>D'o\u00f9 il s'en suit que le jeu peut \u00eatre \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 parce qu'au final, tout en \u00e9tant dans des \"espaces de pouvoirs\" diff\u00e9rents, les diff\u00e9rentes classes peuvent se comparer les unes aux autres et peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es les unes sur les autres.</li> </ul> <p>Je voudrais r\u00e9sumer ces choix de conception par le diagramme suivant :</p>  <p>Le mod\u00e8le est bi-dimensionnel :</p> <ul> <li>Chaque source de pouvoir (par exemple A) peut abriter plusieurs classes qui ne sont pas toutes d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es (par exemple A2) ;</li> <li>Il est possible d'ajouter des sources de pouvoirs pour cr\u00e9er de nouvelles classes ;</li> <li>Dans le futur, il ne sera pas plus difficile qu'aujourd'hui de cr\u00e9er de nouvelles classes au travers de nouvelles sources de pouvoirs (par exemple D).</li> </ul> <p>On peut dire que la conception du mod\u00e8le est plut\u00f4t bien faite, surtout si l'on envisage un monde avec diff\u00e9rents formes de magie.

Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 ma connaissance alors que les r\u00e8gles de OD&amp;D l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 : voir sur le tr\u00e8s bon site La Forge de papier.</p> <p>Il semble que ce soit la premi\u00e8re apparition des pouvoirs psychiques dans le monde du JDR. Leur apparition au sein de D&amp;D a quelque chose d'\u00e9trange, car on pourrait y voir une collision de diverses influences dans la fantasy: le m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique qui favorise la magie et les pouvoirs psychiques qui sent plus le JDR contemporain ou futuriste.</p> <p>D&amp;D propose les pouvoirs psy comme un genre de suppl\u00e9ment optionnel pour \"pimenter\" les parties. L'introduction de 1976 de Tim Kask dudit livre est amusante : </p> <p>L'introduction du combat psionique s'attache \u00e0 redynamiser des jeux devenus ternes. Cela ouvre des possibilit\u00e9s in\u00e9dites \u00e0 la fois pour les joueurs et le MD et, ce faisant, cela permet de se reconnecter \u00e0 l'un des th\u00e8mes favoris des \u00e9crivains de science-fiction et de fantasy : les pouvoirs inconnus de l'esprit.</p> <p>Pour autant, en lisant entre les lignes, l'introduction des d\u00e9mons dans le jeu semble pousser Gygax \u00e0 cr\u00e9er les r\u00e8gles des pouvoirs psychiques, mieux adapt\u00e9s, selon lui, \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les pouvoirs de certains d\u00e9mons.</p> <p>Comme souvent dans OD&amp;D, les r\u00e8gles sont confuses, incompl\u00e8tes, \u00e9clat\u00e9es dans le tout le livret, entrecoup\u00e9es de choses qui n'ont rien \u00e0 voir (le Druide, un syst\u00e8me de combat alternatif bas\u00e9 sur la Dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 Ajust\u00e9e, etc.).
