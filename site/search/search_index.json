GNU Free Documentation License # Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright \u00a9 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE # The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS # This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING # You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY # If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS # You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS # You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS # You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS # A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION # Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION # You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE # The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING # \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.","title":"4. MODIFICATIONS"},{"location":"LICENSE/#5-combining-documents","text":"You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".","title":"5.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.","title":"6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS"},{"location":"LICENSE/#7-aggregation-with-independent-works","text":"A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.","title":"7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS"},{"location":"LICENSE/#8-translation","text":"Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.","title":"8. TRANSLATION"},{"location":"LICENSE/#9-termination","text":"You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.","title":"9.

A long time ago, I played RPGs, mainly CoC, Warhammer, Parano\u00efa, Vampire, Kult, but also French games like Mega II , Bitume , Empire et Dynasties ou L\u00e9gendes . I was never a player of D&D.

Indeed, as I like the D20 system in general, I would like to inspire the Enterprise RPG gaming system from it. The fact is I find it very surprising that there seem to be no dodge or parrying system. In a round (let's says 10 seconds), I would have expected every PC to have at least 1 attack and 1 defense. For sure, the order in the combat sequence is depending upon initiative, which means that if you don't have the initiative, you can try to parry (with your shield or your weapon - BTW, weapon parrying power depends on the weapon because a stick is not a sword) or to dodge. Dodging should be the result of DEX and so have some bonus/malus coming from DEX and some bonus/malus coming from AC (it is more complex to dodge with a plate armor than without). Concerning parrying, it could be done at the same level that the attack, or to be some kind of contest versus the attack of the attacker. However, you should choose to parry with your shield or your weapon. For sure, I think the AC concept theoretically takes into account this fact, but I think it breaks the balance in combat. Let us suppose you are a Monk at level 12: You should be unreachable my most creatures, even if you don't attack and you just dodge. The fact of having 2 attacks per round would give you the same number of defenses. I even think you should be able to turn the attack in a defense if you need it, for instance when attacked by multiple enemies. I have to continue my investigations to see how dodge and parrying are treated in other rule books. I am not really in favor of dodging being a skill: it should be more part of the core combat system. I have to reply on a logical combat system that's why those investigations are interesting. August 30 Spells, classes and armor class # Courtesys of sirdrak Spells Some enterprise PCs have Charism but not only. They are able to seduce people even if their real skills are low. On the contrary, many people can be charmed by those spells, above all if they are not skilled enough to realize the subterfuge. Skills should influence on saving throws with bonuses. Low skills should provide a malus for saving throws. Anyway, the seduction should be considered as a magic power. Magic could be based on Charisma. Classes of characters Indeed, as all PCs are human (are they really? ;), there are no races. But classes of characters also exist. The Classes should match basic profile characteristics. Engineer could be a profile. Salesman or saleswoman another. HR, Marketing, Finance, etc. could be classes. Classically, PC classes should require some level in a certain characteristic. The belonging of a certain \"influence cycle\" should be possible. In France, ENA, X or ENSAM are acting like secret societies that create networks of people assigning themselves positions without them to be always connected to their real skills. That belonging could add some bonus or malus in different situations. Armor class Generally the boss of a company will have a very low armor class. If the business is owned by him, the AC is 1. But for companies where the boss is just a nominated guy, which means he can be replaced, the his AC should be 2 or 3. For the rest of people, their AC should be the boss AC minus the number of hierarchical levels between the boss and the PC position. For instance, let us suppose your PC is the n-5 of a big boss who has an AC=2. Your AC is 7. Note: PC should have AC modifiers depending on the situations. August 27 Create funny rolls # If characteristics are balanced between one extreme and the other, for several situations, it would be quite funny to let the GM decide what \"side\" of the characteristics to roll for. One alternative is to make 2 rolls. I have to think about it. August 27 More characteristics and skills # Let's go straight to the point: many characteristics and skills in Enterprise-RPG must represent the bad reality of companies. Let's try a first list: Characteristic or skill? Type Comment Lying Skill Could be attached to some alignment notion Politics Characteristic Lying could be a skill deriving Physical Characteristic Not so useful Technical skills Skills Per domain Sell Skill Can be used in other contexts Invent stupid project Skill This should probably be generalized to other stupid stuff Misunderstand Skill A good skill for manager is misunderstanding Paranoia Skill Ability to imagine that someone is plotting agains you Plot Skill A useful skill in enterprise Detect Plot Skill Same Bad faith Skill Same A lot of skills should find their places in \"combat rules\". First Ideas About Combat Rules Combat rules could have several flavours: Confrontation: face to face Group combat: influence in a meeting, groupe versus group, etc. Plot August 26 Characteristics # Courtesy of istockphoto.com First inspiration: Jung Each character will have a set of characteristics and skills. I like the skills being specialization of characteristics. I wanted to start with the Jungiang traits. Roughly, Jung defines 3 kinds of attributes. If we adopt the perspective of Myers-Briggs (without adding the 4th trait), we can have: Introversion/Extraversion, which is the place from where people are taking their energy; Intuitive/Sensing, which is the perception of time, intuitive living in the future and being able to anticipate, and sensing living in the present; Thinkful/Feeling, which is the approach of conflict, or based on intellectual facts or based on feeling for people. In all cases, as the \"context\" (understand \"the enterprise the PC are into\") requires certain details on the \"mind characteristics\", we have to find a way to have balanced characteristics. First rules Let's take an example to enable to reflection. Sandra is a woman and she has an argument with Vincent, a man. Vincent is \"Feel\" oriented whereas Sandra is more \"Think\". Let us suppose that we have just one scale: Feel + Think should be a fixed number and Sandra would have much more chances to succeed in an analysis based on Think than an analysis based on Feel (and the reverse for Vincent). However: Those characteristics should both exist in both profiles and be linked together in some way; There is no reason for which those characteristics may be limited. So we can imagine the following rules: For your PC, at PC creation, you have one roll for Think/Feel: roll 3D6 to get X; Choose if X goes to Feel or to Think; Put 18-X in the other characteristic. The result would be for Sandra 3+6+4=13: Characteristic Feel Think Value 5 13 And for Vincent, 1+4+5=10: Characteristic Feel Think Value 10 8 This can enable the standard D20 roll against some threshold to succeed to not in a certain challenge. August 25 What kind of dice? # Courtesy of istockphoto.com The first point will be to decide what kind of dice use. I admit having a preference for standard RPG dices, and not D6, even if most of the quick tabletop RPG seem to be using D6. For now, I will adopt a game system inspired by D&D but the blog is here to enable the reflection on the topic. August 25 What is the enterprise RPG you are talking about? # Courtesy of istockphoto.com The enterprise is an hostile environment in which various set of skills are employed : technical ones, but also political ones. For decades, the enterprise landscape has changed, not really for the best, especially in big structures: Political skills are, more than ever, on the frontline; Technical skills seem to stay in the background; Nowadays, who is concerned about change management, or exact reporting? This blogs starts a reflection around a simulation system that would be adapted to simulate what's going on in modern enterprises in which nothing can be called a failure anymore and everything is always a success, where intentions are too often sufficient. This in-progress game aims to turn catastrophic situations in funny situations. If the exercise is successfull, you will be able : To create the PC (Player Characters) that correspond to your collegues; To predict the output of meetings and to create various kinds of \"encounters\"; To determine who is the best PC or NPC (Non Player Character) to win a challenge or a contest; In one word, to play the roles of your colleagues. In a certain way, this system could be a RPG but would more be a way to have fun in the office with the RPG concepts adapted to the enterprise. More to come.

If we adopt the perspective of Myers-Briggs (without adding the 4th trait), we can have: Introversion/Extraversion, which is the place from where people are taking their energy; Intuitive/Sensing, which is the perception of time, intuitive living in the future and being able to anticipate, and sensing living in the present; Thinkful/Feeling, which is the approach of conflict, or based on intellectual facts or based on feeling for people. In all cases, as the \"context\" (understand \"the enterprise the PC are into\") requires certain details on the \"mind characteristics\", we have to find a way to have balanced characteristics. First rules Let's take an example to enable to reflection. Sandra is a woman and she has an argument with Vincent, a man. Vincent is \"Feel\" oriented whereas Sandra is more \"Think\". Let us suppose that we have just one scale: Feel + Think should be a fixed number and Sandra would have much more chances to succeed in an analysis based on Think than an analysis based on Feel (and the reverse for Vincent). However: Those characteristics should both exist in both profiles and be linked together in some way; There is no reason for which those characteristics may be limited. So we can imagine the following rules: For your PC, at PC creation, you have one roll for Think/Feel: roll 3D6 to get X; Choose if X goes to Feel or to Think; Put 18-X in the other characteristic. The result would be for Sandra 3+6+4=13: Characteristic Feel Think Value 5 13 And for Vincent, 1+4+5=10: Characteristic Feel Think Value 10 8 This can enable the standard D20 roll against some threshold to succeed to not in a certain challenge.

I admit having a preference for standard RPG dices, and not D6, even if most of the quick tabletop RPG seem to be using D6.

For decades, the enterprise landscape has changed, not really for the best, especially in big structures: Political skills are, more than ever, on the frontline; Technical skills seem to stay in the background; Nowadays, who is concerned about change management, or exact reporting? This blogs starts a reflection around a simulation system that would be adapted to simulate what's going on in modern enterprises in which nothing can be called a failure anymore and everything is always a success, where intentions are too often sufficient. This in-progress game aims to turn catastrophic situations in funny situations. If the exercise is successfull, you will be able : To create the PC (Player Characters) that correspond to your collegues; To predict the output of meetings and to create various kinds of \"encounters\"; To determine who is the best PC or NPC (Non Player Character) to win a challenge or a contest; In one word, to play the roles of your colleagues. In a certain way, this system could be a RPG but would more be a way to have fun in the office with the RPG concepts adapted to the enterprise. More to come.

This game really marked the RPG world by violating many tabletop RPG principles: The game master is mandatory: In Mythic GME, he/she isn't anymore (even if sometimes a referee can be useful to decide on odds). The story must be determined before playing: In Mythic, you can play a story with just a starting idea. Randomness can be inserted intelligently at some key points in the story. The game engine is whatever you want, and globally, this is one element among others. With this story system, you can play solo. Mythic GME fostered the imagination of many players and game masters for almost 20 years, especially in the world of solo RPG. What is funny is that some old D&D tables determining, for instance, the way the NPCs react to the PCs can be used easily in a Mythic GME adventure. In some ways, many elements of well-known RPGs can be used in complement with the Fate Chart. I'm currently analyzing the Mythic GME extensions, Mythic Variation I and II, which propose new rules more adapted to the universes you play in, and more adapted to the kind of questions you're asking. September 22 2020 D&D and Gustav Mahler # For sure, there is no link between D&D and Mahler, except that they are various manifestations of the human culture, which is quite vague indeed. The fact is the digging into D&D history is, for me, haoppening at the same time as the digging into my old CDs of the Mahler symphonies. BTW, I miss the 6th for an unknown reason. I stopped listening to Mahler several years ago when I faced many personal troubles. In a certain way, the sadness of the 9th was talking to me, doing echo to my own pain. Those symphonies are associated to a certain period of my life that I don't recall with pleasure. Even if my role-playing phase is much older than Mahler symphonies, synchronicity seems to be there, as Jung would have say. Another Gustav... I created a repo to host the D&D 3.5 original texts, that I found in the Wayback Machine . The idea would be to publish the rough material in a browse-able way in order to progressively being able to integrate elements into programs. I have been struggling yesterday with the conversion of HTML to Markdown, problem for which I found a not-so-bad solution that I put in my stuff repo . The idea is to parse the HTML (generated from RTF by LibreOffice) and to replace tables with images. In a site that support dynamic images (like the ones we can generate with mkdocs ), the material will be mobile friendly. September 20 2020 D&D and the American appetite for wilderness # There is something peculiar about D&D, which could explain why I am not so fond of stories of people fighting with monsters in darks labyrinths. While reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grognardia , the huge attraction for \"wilderness\", which seems at the root of D&D, is a bit foreign to me. Maybe, the reason is cultural. In France, we have a long lasting past and everyone at school studies the Middle-Age, and the Greeks and Romans before that. In a certain way, a \"dungeon\" is just the biggest tower in a castle, where the lord used to live. Chivalry, in the French unconscious, is quite different than the picture that is depicted in D&D: knights have a law code and serve the widow and the orphan. They are often in love with a lady in a romantic way. They may face magic but not in the D&D sense. In a way, the Arthurian legend remains our reference. For a European eye, D&D looks like a western in tunnels with monsters as enemies, instead of Indians. I know, this is a bit provocative, but D&D is not at all a vision of chivalry, as we have traditionally in France. On the contrary: killing monsters, conquer territories and gain treasures to gain levels look, to me, as a caricature of the American dream. D&D element Element of American culture French traditional chivalry element Element of French culture Travel in the wilderness to conquer territories This really seems as the ideal of the Far West, which is typical American culture In French, chivalry, knight quests are for God or for a loved one. Conquering territories is no more considered as a positive thing (colonization is seen as a bad thing) Fight enemies and kill monsters The violence is part of American culture, as the fighting The notion of \"monster\" is present in the European legends but in small doses, probably due to Catholicism Violence is more psychological and verbal than real in French society (maybe because it is forbidden to have weapons) Gain treasure Typical American culture about earthly wealth, which is also typical from protestant countries The knights were fighting for an ideal and not for money, especially money coming from the murder and robbery of other living beings Catholic tradition that sees money as something dirty Gain experience and progress in the levels This can be seen as a real appetite for social ascension, and social competition This appetite also exists but not really in the chivalry tradition Social progression was also a feature of the Baby Boomers, being in the US or in Europe In other words, D&D is a very American game: A universe where violence and murder enables to progress in the society and become more powerful... Maybe that deserves more details than this quick simplistic psycho-analysis, but that may also explain why, for many French people, D&D is not very exciting. In France, we have this expression \"Gros Bill\" (\"Big Bill\") who is supposed to represent the super-hero knight, able to massacre everyone. If I saw many Gros-Bills, I never saw them craving for wilderness. Because we are old countries, most of us don't dream about conquest of the wild countries. For sure, D&D can be played like CoC, with more atmosphere and monsters that are so powerful that your should run instead of fighting. But, discovering progressively the roots of D&D, I think I progress in my understanding of why D&D is not my cup of tea. September 15 2020 Software help for RPGs? # For sure, dice are crucial to RPGs. But knowing that many role players play with tables, I am quite surprised of the \"paper orientation\" of the RPG world. It's obvious that the objective is not to create a graphical RPG, but it could be interesting, for instance, to have random tables managed digitally. Maybe my reflection is driven by some random game helps or by games like Mythic. But in some cases, being able to generate characters dynamically could be really interesting. Indeed, I am quite interested by the mix between random elements and driven elements. If we consider the old school gaming scenarios, the structure is quite often simple: A scenario introduction, with the plot (when there is a plot :), A location description, NPC (quite often monsters) and treasures description. In the case of the use of a GM emulator, easy software tools could be very interesting, something like a web page enabling to manage more complex randomness in a certain context . Interesting topic. September 10 2020 Autum's coming # I like Autumn. Living in the south of France, a very hot region in Summer, Autumn is the end of Summer and so the capacity of walking in the mountains again. The period is also the period of rough storms with heavy rain, which is changing after all those months of sunny and hot days. I just received the Dungeon's Master Guide of D&D 3e. I must admit I am a bit disappointed because the book is not old school, and appears to me as overproduced, nearer from a collection object than to a usable game. But well, I am used to D&D and I must go on. September 8 2020 The big director's roll # Well, I begin to play with dice at work, trying to predict what will happen. I faced today a really interesting case. Let me create the scene (maybe it is a wargame rather than a RPG): You have two teams, one is good and the other is bad. In a contract, each team wrote half of a document to present to a prospect. The overall material is bad, undoubtedly. The prospect screams saying: \"what kind of s**t is it?\" At first, the hierarchy laughs, saying : \"oh yes, no problem, everything's OK, just this stupid prospect that doesn't understand how smart we are. Well, after a while, probably after tectonic management movements (because the prospect reaction has a tendency to climb up the ladder), everyone would like to find a guilty person. For sure, the good team would be a good choice. Because, if the bad team survived, that means they have a specific protection charm that is not in line with their skills: maybe the charm is Not My Fault . So the attention gets to the good team that did a good job. The director of the bad team has a meeting tomorrow with the director of the good team. Indeed, as the team leader of the good team predicted it with his It Smells like Crap psionic power. Working from that prediction, the good team prepared the place for battle with many traps that are reinforced by the Hidden Truth potion. I calculated the odds of the bad director: 25% of being able to convince to good director, after all bonuses and penalties applied. I rolled a 98! Uh! Critical failure... We'll see tomorrow if my Oracle begins to work! September 7 2020 Getting public? # For now, this blog is quite hidden, which is nice. That enables me to dig into the recent (or less recent) RPG story. I kinda like to read the various game systems and compare them. I went recently through old stuff of mine: Simulacres , for instance which is a French game as I dislike them. The game system could have been innovative, but instead it is complicated and even a bit pretentious. I really dislike this feature in French personality: bragging as if French people had invented the hot water (French expression). Nevertheless, I love France and the French. But I would like to see more really creative stuff, playable stuff, modest, optimized, efficient, creative, straight to the point stuff, than those crappy \"I am the best and I teach you\" products. In the past, many game designers have indulged the pleasure of farting higher than their asses (other French expression, rather sympathetic this one), and I dislike it. I would say that Croc is probably one of a kind, that did not, or at least I don't remember. Maybe also the one who created the French RPG where you play lycanthropes. I'll find the name back. Well, the fact is, there are many RPGs that I find unplayable, but they don't feel as if they were lecturing me on something. That's the power of Americans. There is so much competition, that people try their best to do the best product. I see also a certain kind of \"focus\" in some American games. We're here for something particular: role-playing in a certain universe, and not benefiting from that tribune to insinuate political of social-crap stuff. A game is a game and no moral lesson from your grand-pa. September 7 2020 The winning couple for a RPG starting now with no preparation? # I analyzed extensively the Risus RPG (which is short so that didn't take much time) and created a flowchart to sum-up this micro-game (in French). Yes, my intention is to translate stuff when I can and when the license enables it. France is a great country for RPGs, even if I often find the French RPG a bit patronizing... As the French maybe. Anyway, in order to play without any preparation, nor at the game mechanics level, or at the scenario level, maybe the winning couple is Risus + Mythic . Risus is a funny game with very simple game mechanics, that are similar to some other mini-RPGs such as Cthulhu Dark ( French version ) or the children game FirstFable ( French version ) or even the very micro-game Roll for Shoes ( French version ). I think the emergence of mini-RPGs is the proof of some RPG players getting old. When you are young, you are keen to work hard in very large rule books. When you are older, you can run on the accumulated capacities of GM-ing that you have accumulated for so many years. The problem of older players is, for sure, the availability of other players. When everyone has its life, it's not so easy to meet. So, quite often, the sessions are scarcer, and with less players (unless you enroll your own children). For that, simple game engines can be a good way to address the rule part preparation. Remains the adventure itself for which you can use many tools: generators or even GM emulators if you really don't have the time to prepare a story. Concerning GM emulation, I think it would be great to use it inside a pre-existing universe. I have to investigate on that. September 7 2020 A very creative period # It's been a long time since I did not have a look to the RPG world, almost 25 years! For sure, I discovered that a multitude of RPGs and RPG engines were created in 25 years, and some of them seem to me as particularly notable. One of them is Mythic GM Emulator . This engine defined a new way to envisage to RPG by playing adventures with a level of randomness and possibly with no GM. I will write more about that game soon. I must admit that, a long time ago, I know many players that would have been greatly satisfied with that kind of engine. This creative period is very interesting because, for the RPG player and GM, there are plenty of offers, and most of them quite affordable. Many are Creative Commons or open source, or free. There is also the dominant position of DriveThruRPG as a global dealer of RPGs. I can see many great evolutions in the RPG universe in those last years : The development of Internet enabled many independant authors to create very interesting material, very often for a limited price. The development of print on demand enabled also to differentiate the selling of PDFs from the selling of printed manuals, which is great, considering the disappearance of many gaming shops (at least in France). The SRD 3.5 opened the door to re-interpretations of old school ways of playing RPGs, which can be a good thing. Games should offer many variations and attract several kinds of players. On this topic, I started reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grogniardia . It is very intesting and enables me to catch on with the RPG world. There are some good moments, in this blog, about the old school RPG gaming, mostly based on the the 2 first editions of D&D (OD&D and Holmes mainly). Even if I was never a player of D&D, the old school is talking to me. The age, maybe. The passion for CoC also where I find the same kind of objectives: play with not so many rules, have fun, and improvise. Maybe we are not so far from each other after all. The fact is, the period from 2000 to 2010 seems very creative, whereas I am not so sure that the following decade was (the one that is terminating now). I have to investigate. In some dimensions, I understand old school fanatics to be sad that things changed. But on the other hand, we still have many choices in the offer, so much actually that searching for the product that corresponds to you can be quite long. But I think we should not complain. It is just a new era of RPG with several generations playing the same kind of games and so expecting different things from it. For sure, everyone is not playing a single \"universal\" game, but, without being a specialist, when I see all the supplements produced by Paizo on PathFinder, I wonder if most players are not still concentrated on heroic-fantasy games around the D&D rules (being 3rd edition or another).

The SRD 3.5 opened the door to re-interpretations of old school ways of playing RPGs, which can be a good thing. Games should offer many variations and attract several kinds of players. On this topic, I started reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grogniardia . It is very intesting and enables me to catch on with the RPG world. There are some good moments, in this blog, about the old school RPG gaming, mostly based on the the 2 first editions of D&D (OD&D and Holmes mainly). Even if I was never a player of D&D, the old school is talking to me. The age, maybe. The passion for CoC also where I find the same kind of objectives: play with not so many rules, have fun, and improvise. Maybe we are not so far from each other after all. The fact is, the period from 2000 to 2010 seems very creative, whereas I am not so sure that the following decade was (the one that is terminating now). I have to investigate. In some dimensions, I understand old school fanatics to be sad that things changed. But on the other hand, we still have many choices in the offer, so much actually that searching for the product that corresponds to you can be quite long. But I think we should not complain. It is just a new era of RPG with several generations playing the same kind of games and so expecting different things from it. For sure, everyone is not playing a single \"universal\" game, but, without being a specialist, when I see all the supplements produced by Paizo on PathFinder, I wonder if most players are not still concentrated on heroic-fantasy games around the D&D rules (being 3rd edition or another).

C'est ici : Premi\u00e8re partie , Deuxi\u00e8me partie , Troisi\u00e8me partie . A la lecture de cette critique, je ne suis pas tr\u00e8s chaud pour acheter. C'est mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 grognard, je suppose, mais l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, Lulu m'a permis de r\u00e9imprimer tous les anciens suppl\u00e9ments. J'ai m\u00eame fait r\u00e9imprimer un tarot qui est comme l'original mais en nettement mieux, avec des vraies cartes et tout et tout... C'est la magie de notre \u00e9poque. Rien n'est impossible sur Internet. 28 mai 2022 Lulu : de la joie pour les grognards, deuxi\u00e8me partie : Ghostbusters # Voil\u00e0, je les ai re\u00e7us ! L'origine du syst\u00e8me D6 ! La premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition de Ghostbusters RPG est sortie en 1986. Elle est \u00e9crite par : Sandy Petersen : on ne le pr\u00e9sente plus, le cr\u00e9ateur, entre autres, de l'Appel de Cthulhu ; Lynn Willis : impliqu\u00e9 sur Runequest, co-auteur de la campagne Les masques de Nyarlathotep ; Greg Stafford : l'inventeur de Glorantha et le p\u00e8re de Runequest. A l'\u00e9poque, tous ces gens sont chez Chaosium et West End Games (WEG) fait appel \u00e0 eux pour cr\u00e9er le jeu Ghostbusters. L'id\u00e9e est de cr\u00e9er un jeu tr\u00e8s simple permettant \u00e0 tous de jouer rapidement sans beaucoup de pr\u00e9paration et avec des D6 seulement. Le mat\u00e9riel de la bo\u00eete de base est riche : Ghostbusters a des c\u00f4t\u00e9s Call of Cthulhu, mais en mode \"fun\". Par exemple, la caract\u00e9ristique \"Cool\" est proche de la sant\u00e9 mentale, mais en plus large. On trouve aussi les fameux livres maudits, m\u00eame si, dans le cas de Ghostbusters, ces derniers parlent de fant\u00f4mes. Le gros morceau de la bo\u00eete est le \"Operations Manual\" dont voici le sommaire : J'ai retravaill\u00e9 les PDFs originaux trouv\u00e9s sur les sites de fans US pour avoir tout en un volume (scenarii inclus). Le manuel des op\u00e9rations est tr\u00e8s ax\u00e9 sur les aventures, ce qui est assez peu usuel pour une bo\u00eete de base. Pour la version Ghostbusters International (1989) , j'ai s\u00e9par\u00e9 le mat\u00e9riel en trois livres que l'on voit sur la photo : Les r\u00e8gles du jeu, Les sc\u00e9narios, Le \"Tobin's spirit Guide\". Environ 30\u20ac chez Lulu... Je ne suis vraiment pas pay\u00e9 pour leur faire de la pub, mais, c'est vraiment la joie chez les grognards ! Voir aussi la page sur la comparaison des syst\u00e8mes de jeu D6 . 28 mai 2022 Lulu : de la joie pour les grognards : Star Wars 1e # Je ne sais pas si je suis un Grognard mais Lulu me met en joie. Pourquoi ? Je ne suis pas contre acheter des vieux JDR. J'ai rat\u00e9 plus de 20 ans de l'histoire du hobby, j'ai donn\u00e9 quelques unes de mes reliques de JDR \u00e0 mon fr\u00e8re voil\u00e0 des ann\u00e9es (dont une bo\u00eete de D&D rouge 1e en fran\u00e7ais presque neuve !), c'est normal que je veuille combler mes lacunes avec des vieux trucs. Le probl\u00e8me, c'est que, ces vieilleries ne sont pas simples \u00e0 trouver et, quand on les trouve, elles sont souvent ch\u00e8res. Ces derniers temps, j'ai acquis pour quelques euros les 3 volumes de D&D 3.5 en \u00e9tat correct \u00e0 bon. A l'\u00e9tranger. J'ai aussi trouv\u00e9 M\u00e9ga 3 en \u00e9dition Descartes, \u00e9dition compl\u00e8tement scandaleuse (reprise avec les fautes du num\u00e9ro sp\u00e9cial de Casus avec une intro focalis\u00e9e sur les errata), mais acquise pour le sc\u00e9nario. J'ai aussi laiss\u00e9 dans mon pass\u00e9, une premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition fran\u00e7aise de Star Wars D6 WEG et le sourcebook qui allait avec. J'ai d\u00fb retravailler un peu les PDF qui se trouvent tr\u00e8s facilement, WEG ayant cess\u00e9 d'exister et je me suis fait une petite commande Lulu, le premier en cartonn\u00e9 super couleurs (un vrai fac-simil\u00e9 de l'\u00e9dition originale US) et le second en cartonn\u00e9 N&B, respectivement 28\u20ac et 10\u20ac. Je lisais l'autre fois dans le mail de Black Book que le papier devient cher, mais de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 je dois dire que je n'ai pas vu la diff\u00e9rence. Un fac-simil\u00e9 1e cartonn\u00e9 couleur pour moins de 30\u20ac, en France, c'est du jamais vu. J'ai pas mal utilis\u00e9 Lulu pour des livres, notamment des 18\u00e8me et 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cles, et franchement, c'est imbattable, que ce soit au niveau qualit\u00e9 ou au niveau prix. En plus, vous avez une \u00e9dition unique et c'est fait en France, d'o\u00f9 un d\u00e9lai moyen de deux semaines pour avoir les ouvrages. Raahah (r\u00e2le du grognard), je suis content ! Star Wars D6 est une \u00e9tape de plus dans mon exploration grognardesque des syst\u00e8mes de jeu D6, apr\u00e8s Risus et Ghostbusters. D'ailleurs, demain, je re\u00e7ois Ghostbusters 1e et 2e (international edition) avec tous les suppl\u00e9ments WEG en provenance directe de l'imprimeur fran\u00e7ais qui bosse pour Lulu ! Trop bon ! 26 mai 2022 Probabilit\u00e9s de x d6 contre y D6 (suite) # J'ai d\u00e9taill\u00e9 un peu l'explication des probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s de x d6 contre y d6 en combat dans une page d\u00e9di\u00e9e sur mon github . Il faudrait comparer avec des syst\u00e8mes de jeu ayant des scores de combat fixes et des moyens lin\u00e9aires de les tester. 24 mai 2022 La Grande Liste Des Intrigues de jeu de r\u00f4les # La Grande Liste des intrigues de jeu de r\u00f4les est une cr\u00e9ation de S. John Ross, l'inventeur de Risus . Ce suppl\u00e9ment gratuit vient d'un article que John a \u00e9crit en plusieurs versions et qui d\u00e9crit les intrigues g\u00e9n\u00e9riques de tous les sc\u00e9narios qu'il avait pu lire. En un sens, John Ross reprend le flambeau du livre de Vladimir Propp, la Morphologie du Conte . Ce livre est un jalon important dans l'analyse des contes de f\u00e9es dans la mesure o\u00f9 il prend le sujet par la structure des contes, et montre que, bien qu'en apparence tr\u00e8s nombreux et divers, tous les contes analys\u00e9s ob\u00e9issent \u00e0 une m\u00eame \"\u00e9quation\". Des ann\u00e9es plus tard, ayant d\u00e9couvert la Grande Liste, j'ai eu l'impression que John Ross red\u00e9couvrait ce m\u00eame concept. Sans aller jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9quation, ce dernier propose une liste d'intrigues, des variations et des possibles retournements, qui font que la plupart des intrigues de sc\u00e9narios semblent entrer dans ces quelques pages. Il fournit aussi un conseil trivial, mais \u00e0 ne pas oublier : dans les JDRs, l'intrigue est souvent simple ; ce sont les personnages qui la rendent attirante. L'intrigue n'est rien sans les r\u00f4les, ceux des PJs mais aussi ceux des PNJs qui donnent une couleur particuli\u00e8re. Je ne pense pas qu'il existait une version traduite avant celle que j'ai mis en ligne. A t\u00e9l\u00e9charger \u00e0 tout prix ! 23 mai 2022 Handel, M\u00e9ga et le jeu de r\u00f4les # Ecouter Ce disque m'a beaucoup marqu\u00e9. Il m'a fait aimer Handel. Quel rapport avec le JDR ? Aucun sans doute. Je lis les blogs de ceux qui n'ont jamais perdu le contact avec le jeu, et je me sens un peu \u00e9tranger. Je ne suis pas encore re-rentr\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement dedans. Tiens, sur le blog de Imaginos, un lien vers un topo sur M\u00e9ga 5 . Je vais attendre un peu. Je suis dans M\u00e9ga 3 et le 4, ayant trouv\u00e9 une bonne occase papier de M\u00e9ga 3 que je n'avais jamais lu. Dans tous les cas, on ne jouera sans doute jamais avec le moteur de jeu original, mais soit avec Risus et mon extension simpliste pour Risus M\u00e9ga , soit avec un autre moteur simpliste mais adapt\u00e9 aux pouvoirs psy. Comme je ne suis pas compl\u00e8tement satisfait du syst\u00e8me Risus, je regarde Ghostbusters et Troika qui me plaisent bien au niveau de m\u00e9canique de jeu simpliste. Ghostbusters est un jeu marrant qui a inspir\u00e9 Star Wars 1e avec sa m\u00e9canique de groupe de d6s (d6 pool). Troika est dans la continuit\u00e9 des jeux dont on est le h\u00e9ros. Je sais qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en fran\u00e7ais mais il ne semble pas (encore ?) disponible \u00e0 l'achat. Dans tous les cas, je suis en train de le traduire et de l'adapter de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9. H\u00e9 oui, je recherche encore un syst\u00e8me de jeu simpliste mais sympa pour jouer dans tous les univers. C'est mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 blaireau. 22 mai 2022 Machins de 2020 sur les ricains # Marrant, sur ce sujet, ma femme me disait que les am\u00e9ricains avaient un type de n\u00e9vrose collective tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciale : celle de n'avoir pas de pass\u00e9, ou plut\u00f4t de refouler leur pass\u00e9 /en tant qu'europ\u00e9ens/. Des choses, simples pour nous, les font r\u00eaver, particuli\u00e8rement le Moyen-Age. Pareil, sur un podcast de dicegeeks.com , j'ai entendu une discussions sur les dinosaures en tant que monstres dans les JDRs. \u00c9trange discussion de gens qui se rendent compte que visiter des labyrinthes (les fameux \"dungeons\") pour buter des monstres, c'est facile comme jeu mais c'est pas hyper sain, dans l'absolu. Une phrase excellente de Matt Davis : \"jouer comme \u00e7a \u00e0 D&D, c'est vraiment faire du wargame ; ce n'est pas du JDR\". Cela m'a fait penser \u00e0 tout un tas de choses qui font tripper les am\u00e9ricains, notamment des trucs moyen\u00e2geux tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diocres qui ne nous impressionnent pas, nous les Frenchies.

Cela fait un moment que je me pose des questions sur le syst\u00e8me D6. J'avais commenc\u00e9 sur le syst\u00e8me D6 ici : https://github.com/orey/jdr/tree/master/D6-System Je me souviens que j'avais beaucoup aim\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me de Star Wars avant de d\u00e9couvrir que des diff\u00e9rences de nombres de d\u00e9s \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s difficiles \u00e0 compenser. R\u00e9cemment, je me suis remis \u00e0 fond dans Risus et l\u00e0 encore, le syst\u00e8me Risus, surtout en mode combat, Clich\u00e9 contre Chich\u00e9, avec chaque clich\u00e9 ayant un certain nombre de d6, m'a fait me poser de grandes questions. Je suis revenu \u00e0 la source en analysant Ghostbusters (en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement gratuit sur le lien). Le syst\u00e8me est le m\u00eame, sans doute plus flexible que le syst\u00e8me Risus (j'y reviendrai). Je me suis dit que, vraisemblablement, des gens avaient d\u00fb travailler les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s d'un combat de 3d6 contre 4d6, par exemple. Je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9, si bien que j'ai fait un petit tableur et un petit programme pour pouvoir le calculer. Les r\u00e9sultats sont l\u00e0 : On voit bien sur ces deux tableaux l'ampleur des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. D\u00e8s que les deux combattants ont un d6 d'\u00e9cart, les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s chutent. Dans Risus, ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne peut \u00eatre compens\u00e9 par la Gonflette, mais cette derni\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteuse car, si elle permet de booster sur un round (il faut l'envisager dans un combat o\u00f9 l'on se sert de plusieurs Clich\u00e9s), le co\u00fbt ensuite de -1d6 est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s violent. Dans Ghostbusters, c'est plus malin, je trouve : on prend un bon point qui devient un d6 suppl\u00e9mentaire, histoire d'\u00eatre plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Et comme les PJs ont normalement plein de bons points, on peut en consommer quelques uns durant un combat. De m\u00e9moire, dans Star Wars, il y a aussi un moyen de \"booster\" pour compenser provisoirement le d\u00e9calage sur une action.

L'origine du syst\u00e8me D6 ! La premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition de Ghostbusters RPG est sortie en 1986. Elle est \u00e9crite par : Sandy Petersen : on ne le pr\u00e9sente plus, le cr\u00e9ateur, entre autres, de l'Appel de Cthulhu ; Lynn Willis : impliqu\u00e9 sur Runequest, co-auteur de la campagne Les masques de Nyarlathotep ; Greg Stafford : l'inventeur de Glorantha et le p\u00e8re de Runequest. A l'\u00e9poque, tous ces gens sont chez Chaosium et West End Games (WEG) fait appel \u00e0 eux pour cr\u00e9er le jeu Ghostbusters. L'id\u00e9e est de cr\u00e9er un jeu tr\u00e8s simple permettant \u00e0 tous de jouer rapidement sans beaucoup de pr\u00e9paration et avec des D6 seulement. Le mat\u00e9riel de la bo\u00eete de base est riche : Ghostbusters a des c\u00f4t\u00e9s Call of Cthulhu, mais en mode \"fun\". Par exemple, la caract\u00e9ristique \"Cool\" est proche de la sant\u00e9 mentale, mais en plus large. On trouve aussi les fameux livres maudits, m\u00eame si, dans le cas de Ghostbusters, ces derniers parlent de fant\u00f4mes. Le gros morceau de la bo\u00eete est le \"Operations Manual\" dont voici le sommaire : J'ai retravaill\u00e9 les PDFs originaux trouv\u00e9s sur les sites de fans US pour avoir tout en un volume (scenarii inclus). Le manuel des op\u00e9rations est tr\u00e8s ax\u00e9 sur les aventures, ce qui est assez peu usuel pour une bo\u00eete de base. Pour la version Ghostbusters International (1989) , j'ai s\u00e9par\u00e9 le mat\u00e9riel en trois livres que l'on voit sur la photo : Les r\u00e8gles du jeu, Les sc\u00e9narios, Le \"Tobin's spirit Guide\".

Le probl\u00e8me, c'est que, ces vieilleries ne sont pas simples \u00e0 trouver et, quand on les trouve, elles sont souvent ch\u00e8res. Ces derniers temps, j'ai acquis pour quelques euros les 3 volumes de D&D 3.5 en \u00e9tat correct \u00e0 bon. A l'\u00e9tranger.

Je lisais l'autre fois dans le mail de Black Book que le papier devient cher, mais de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 je dois dire que je n'ai pas vu la diff\u00e9rence. Un fac-simil\u00e9 1e cartonn\u00e9 couleur pour moins de 30\u20ac, en France, c'est du jamais vu. J'ai pas mal utilis\u00e9 Lulu pour des livres, notamment des 18\u00e8me et 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cles, et franchement, c'est imbattable, que ce soit au niveau qualit\u00e9 ou au niveau prix.

En un sens, John Ross reprend le flambeau du livre de Vladimir Propp, la Morphologie du Conte . Ce livre est un jalon important dans l'analyse des contes de f\u00e9es dans la mesure o\u00f9 il prend le sujet par la structure des contes, et montre que, bien qu'en apparence tr\u00e8s nombreux et divers, tous les contes analys\u00e9s ob\u00e9issent \u00e0 une m\u00eame \"\u00e9quation\".

Il fournit aussi un conseil trivial, mais \u00e0 ne pas oublier : dans les JDRs, l'intrigue est souvent simple ; ce sont les personnages qui la rendent attirante. L'intrigue n'est rien sans les r\u00f4les, ceux des PJs mais aussi ceux des PNJs qui donnent une couleur particuli\u00e8re.

Le r\u00e9sultat est impeccable. Le livre fait un peu plus de 18\u20ac, tout en couleurs...

D'abord, il fallait sacr\u00e9ment bien parler l'anglais, je m'en rends compte aujourd'hui, car Gary \u00e9crit plut\u00f4t pas mal. Ensuite, il fallait passer des semaines \u00e0 lire et dig\u00e9rer tout ce mat\u00e9riel.

Donc, il y a deux ans, je n'avais rien. En me remettant un peu dans le coup, j'ai d\u00e9couvert la vague OSR et la fameuse version D&D 3e et 3.5e. En cherchant un peu, j'ai trouv\u00e9 les 3 bouquins d'occase. Le jeu est quand m\u00eame bien touffu. Puis j'ai repris les investigations sur D&D : d'abord sur D&D 0e, puis sur AD&D 1e o\u00f9 j'ai profit\u00e9 d'une promotion dur DmsGuild pour acheter les 3 bouquins en reprint. En plus de l'\u00e9dition 3.5, j'ai lu l'\u00e9dition gratuite de D&D 5e Basic Rules que j'ai fait imprimer chez Lulu (premi\u00e8re tentative, pas top au niveau rendu). Voil\u00e0.

Par exemple, Colostle, qui semble faire son petit effet dans la sph\u00e8re des Ennies 2022, est un jeu sympa, plut\u00f4t pour ados, et son utilisation des cartes (jeu de 54 cartes) \u00e0 la place des d\u00e9s est une id\u00e9e sympathique, qui n'est pas sans rappeler celle de Fortune Wheels qui est aussi un jeu anglais. C\u00f4t\u00e9 probabilit\u00e9s, cela innove un peu : dans un jeu complet, on a une chance sur 13 de tirer une carte, mais si le jeu \u00e9carte les cartes d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9es, cela modifie les probabilit\u00e9s... Bref, venons-en \u00e0 WWN. J'avais lu quelques trucs sur ce jeu, en fait plut\u00f4t sur Stars Without Numbers . Je t\u00e9l\u00e9charge et je tourne les pages. D\u00e9j\u00e0, le volume du livre me semble inhabituel (352 pages). C'est de l'OSR mais avec pas mal de choses int\u00e9ressantes. Puis en page 94, le monde commence \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9crit, puis viennent 200 pages environ de tables pour cr\u00e9er sa campagne, son aventure, etc. Ouahou, quel gigantesque travail. R\u00e9sultat, je me fais une commande de version gratuite sur Lulu et cette derni\u00e8re doit arriver demain. Je pense que je vais l'emporter en vacances car c'est une somme impressionnante qui m\u00e9rite un peu d'attention.

A quand des Ennies fran\u00e7ais ? 24 juillet 2022 Fighting Fantasy 1984 en fran\u00e7ais # Fighting Fantasy (FF), le moteur des Livres dont vous \u00cates le H\u00e9ros # Fighting Fantasy est une s\u00e9rie de livres de jeux de r\u00f4les pour un seul joueur cr\u00e9\u00e9e par Steve Jackson (le Steve Jackson anglais et non celui de GURPS qui est am\u00e9ricain) et Ian Livingstone . Le premier volume de la s\u00e9rie fut publi\u00e9 en livre de poche par Pufin en 1982. Cette s\u00e9rie propose un syst\u00e8me de jeu de r\u00f4les tr\u00e8s simple qui fut ensuite compl\u00e9t\u00e9 de diverses fa\u00e7ons, notamment dans le livre Dungeoneer, Advanced Fighting Fantasy , publi\u00e9 en 1989. R\u00e9cemment, le syst\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 repris et customis\u00e9 dans le jeu de r\u00f4les Troika! . Une modeste synth\u00e8se des r\u00e8gles en deux pages # Le document de deux pages que je viens de terminer reprend les r\u00e8gles originales de 1984. J'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 un draft en stock mais je n'\u00e9tais pas totalement satisfait de la pr\u00e9sentation (manque de temps pour finaliser les choses). Comme je voudrais poster cette synth\u00e8se de deux pages du FF de 1984 sur itch.io , j'ai demand\u00e9 sur le site de FF les conditions de le licence. Je vais voir ce qu'ils r\u00e9pondent. La version de 1984 est super l\u00e9g\u00e8re : Elle ne poss\u00e8de pas le syst\u00e8me de comp\u00e9tences avanc\u00e9es que l'on trouve dans Dungeoneer , Elle ne comprend pas de syst\u00e8me de magie. Le contexte Troika! # Je suis en train de traduire Troika! depuis le SRD en mettant en illustration une toile de ma\u00eetre quand je le peux. Cela donne une certaine \"couleur\" au jeu. Comme le syst\u00e8me de jeu de Troika! est celui de Advanced Fighting Fantasy, l\u00e9g\u00e8rement adapt\u00e9 (sur la COMP notamment), j'ai voulu remettre en forme ma version de synth\u00e8se des r\u00e8gles de FF 1984 pour comprendre un peu la g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie du truc. A noter que FF et Troika! sont deux produits anglais, et qu'il est impossible \u00e0 tout r\u00f4liste anglais de ma g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de ne pas conna\u00eetre FF. En fait, ce qui me botte dans ce syst\u00e8me, c'est son accessibilit\u00e9, et notamment la capacit\u00e9 de jouer avec des ados en quelques minutes. Comme avec Ghostbusters , le syst\u00e8me se ma\u00eetrise en un rien de temps. Reboot de Advanced Fighting Fantasy # A ce propos, Advanced Fighting Fantasy a \u00e9t\u00e9 reboot\u00e9 par Arion Games. Ils en sont m\u00eame \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9dition. Par contre, le graphisme int\u00e9rieur ne m'a pas totalement s\u00e9duit. Il y a tant d'artistes de talent dans le monde de la fantasy que c'est dommage de faire une mise en page comme je la fais si on a quelques moyens. 24 juillet 2022 News # Voil\u00e0 les sujets qui m'ont occup\u00e9 ces derniers temps : Je poursuis la traduction de Troika! C'est un gros travail surtout dans un contexte de manque structurel de temps. Elle sera sans doute gratuite.

J'ai vot\u00e9 pour les Ennies 2022 et ce fut un gros travail. Quelques trucs int\u00e9ressants dans la sc\u00e8ne TTRPG alternative mais il faudrait que j'ai plus de temps.

Il faut que j'int\u00e8gre le facteur de chaos au eGME (voir plus bas). 23 juillet 2022 A propos de la premi\u00e8re version du \"eGME\" en ligne # La version du GME (beta) fait appel \u00e0 quelques concepts de Mythic que je trouve bien. Je vais le nommer \"eGME\" pour le distinguer du GME Mythic notamment (et puis c'est moins long \u00e0 \u00e9crire). Concept 1 : les sc\u00e8nes et leur structure # Le jeu solo est un ensemble de sc\u00e8nes. Ces sc\u00e8nes font appara\u00eetre des PNJ et des pistes (des intrigues). Figure 1 : vue de la structure des sc\u00e8nes du eGME Concept 2 : la sc\u00e8ne a trois \u00e9tats # La sc\u00e8ne poss\u00e8de 3 \u00e9tats diff\u00e9rents : Au d\u00e9but, on d\u00e9crit comme elle commence, elle est \"normale\" ; Elle peut \u00eatre \"alt\u00e9r\u00e9e\", soit modifi\u00e9e suite \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ; Elle peut \u00eatre \"interrompue\", ce qui signifie qu'autre chose se passe (pilot\u00e9 par un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire Concept 3 : le facteur de chaos # Dans Mythic et ses extensions, il existe plusieurs fa\u00e7ons, en d\u00e9but de sc\u00e8ne, de savoir si cette derni\u00e8re subit une modification. Dans le Mythic GME, c'est le facteur de chaos qui pilote ce param\u00e8tre. Figure 2 : vue de la table du destin de Mythic Le principe du facteur de chaos est que, en fin de sc\u00e8ne, suivant ce que le PJ a ma\u00eetris\u00e9 ou pas, le facteur de chaos diminue ou augmente. Plus le facteur de chaos est grand, plus le risque d'avoir un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire est important. Le facteur de chaos est test\u00e9 en d\u00e9but de sc\u00e8ne. Il d\u00e9cide si une sc\u00e8ne doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e ou pas. Ce concept est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant car il rend le GME \u00e0 la fois plus incertain et pilot\u00e9 par un genre de contexte ext\u00e9rieur de ma\u00eetrise du PJ. Pour l'instant, le facteur de chaos n'est pas impl\u00e9ment\u00e9 dans le GME et la raison est expliqu\u00e9e ci-dessous. Concept 4 : le facteur de chaos comme perturbateur des r\u00e9ponses de l'oracle # Figure 3 : l'oracle dans le eGME L'oracle de Mythic est bas\u00e9 sur une estimation de la probabilit\u00e9 d'occurrence d'un certain \u00e9v\u00e9nement. En fonction de cette probabilit\u00e9, le jet de 1d100 aura plus ou moins de chances de faire dire \"oui\" \u00e0 l'oracle. L'id\u00e9e de Mythic GME est que le facteur de chaos devrait intervenir comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment perturbateur dans les r\u00e9ponses de l'oracle. Cela donne la table du destin en figure 2. Le parti pris par Tana Pigeon, cr\u00e9atrice de Mythic, est d'augmenter les chances pour l'oracle de r\u00e9pondre oui \u00e0 la question quand le facteur de chaos est \u00e9lev\u00e9. Cette option est au final, assez inadapt\u00e9e, car, durant toute la sc\u00e8ne, l'oracle aura une fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre homog\u00e8ne mais distordue. De plus, il est alors facile de lui poser des questions auxquelles le joueur voudrait qu'il r\u00e9ponde oui. J'ai impl\u00e9ment\u00e9 cette version de l'oracle ici , mais elle n'est pas utilis\u00e9e dans le eGME. Tana Pigeon, consciente du probl\u00e8me, a propos\u00e9 dans Mythic Variations 2 une autre fa\u00e7on d'int\u00e9grer l'impact du chaos dans l'oracle. J'avoue que cette solution est plus maligne car elle plus al\u00e9atoire. Elle est aussi impl\u00e9ment\u00e9e l\u00e0 . Mais elle n'est pas utilis\u00e9e dans le eGME. En fait, je ne suis pas satisfait de ce game design. Apr\u00e8s une analyse qu'on pourra trouver ici , je me suis mis \u00e0 tester en mode papier une autre version de cette int\u00e9gration. Concept 4 : l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire # Mythic et Mythic Variation 1 offre diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire. Figure 4 : l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire dans le eGME Cette fonction est impl\u00e9ment\u00e9e dans le eGME et elle est bien. On pourrait certes challenger les tables sur lesquelles elle repose, mais au final, cette fonction est tr\u00e8s utilisable. Un des probl\u00e8mes de game design est : quand invoquer cette fonction dans le jeu, surtout si l'on veut l'invoquer dans le cadre d'une question pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'oracle ? Quels sont les besoins ? # Une des fa\u00e7ons d'int\u00e9grer un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire dans le r\u00e9sultat de l'oracle est par exemple de d\u00e9clencher cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement sur un jet de d\u00e9s double avec 1d100. Cela fait une chance sur 10 d'avoir un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire. On pourrait aussi faire un test de chaos \u00e0 un certain moment, en fonction d'un r\u00e9sultat donn\u00e9 par l'oracle. L'oracle r\u00e9pond de mani\u00e8re classique les choses suivantes : Oui et... Oui Oui mais... Non mais... Non Non et... On pourrait convenir que d\u00e8s que l'oracle r\u00e9pond \"et...\" alors un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire se produit, soit positivement, soit n\u00e9gativement. Il est aussi possible de faire en sorte qu'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire ne se produise qu'en cas de \"non et...\", car dans ce cas, potentiellement, il faut, dans tous les cas, que le joueur trouve une autre solution. Voil\u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de mes r\u00e9flexions sur le sujet. Pour le moment donc, le facteur de chaos n'est pas impl\u00e9ment\u00e9, mais j'y songe. 23 juillet 2022 La premi\u00e8re version de mon GME en ligne # C'est ici : GME (beta) Il fait pas mal de choses et est 100% utilisable offline. Il faudrait sans doute que j'harmonise les couleurs avec le site. Je commenterai une autre fois, je manque de temps. Pour m\u00e9moire, GME = Game Master Emulator. 26 juin 2022 Harry Potter le JDR, le top du top # Bon, je ne suis pas souvent impressionn\u00e9 par les productions fran\u00e7aises mais l\u00e0, force est de constater que nous avons un jeu d'une qualit\u00e9 remarquable. Comme je d\u00e9barque apr\u00e8s plus de deux d\u00e9cennies sans JDR, j'avoue que je connais pas Keul , l'auteur du jeu, mais son travail est vraiment remarquable : Harry Potter, le JDR Bon, certes, j'aime bien, le Basic RolePlaying (BRP) system de Chaosium, mais j'avoue que, lorsque j'ai trouv\u00e9 ce bijou sur Internet voil\u00e0 deux ans, cela m'a donn\u00e9 envie de rejouer... avec ma fille et ma femme. A tel point que j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Lulu de me l'imprimer. Je comprends qu'il y a un probl\u00e8me de droits, mais Keul devrait sans doute se rapprocher de J. K. Rowling ou de son agent, car son JDR est le plus complet et le mieux fait que l'on puisse voir sur le sujet (m\u00eame si d'autres ont tent\u00e9, en fran\u00e7ais). Bravo \u00e0 Keul encore pour ce travail impressionnant ! 06 juin 20222 Analyse de la table du destin de Mythic GME # Je travaille en ce moment \u00e0 une petite collection de programmes permettant de jouer en solo avec une construction d'histoire dynamique.

L'id\u00e9e de Mythic GME est que le facteur de chaos devrait intervenir comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment perturbateur dans les r\u00e9ponses de l'oracle. Cela donne la table du destin en figure 2. Le parti pris par Tana Pigeon, cr\u00e9atrice de Mythic, est d'augmenter les chances pour l'oracle de r\u00e9pondre oui \u00e0 la question quand le facteur de chaos est \u00e9lev\u00e9.

L'incompr\u00e9hensible sp\u00e9cialisation des sc\u00e9narios \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de jeu. Par exemple, tout jeu D&D aurait pu avoir sa traduction pour Runequest ou Warhammer. Je crois avoir vu cela dans un seul num\u00e9ro de Casus. Et comment font les joueurs ? Ils font la traduction seuls ? L'hyperfocalisation sur Shadowrun qui n'est tout de m\u00eame pas le jeu du si\u00e8cle. Des sc\u00e9narios sur des jeux de troisi\u00e8me zone, impossibles \u00e0 trouver en boutique \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Un soutien absolu \u00e0 R\u00eave de Dragon que, franchement, personne ne jouait autour de moi. Je m'\u00e9tais toujours demand\u00e9 pourquoi Pendragon n'avait pas perc\u00e9 en France, mais c'\u00e9tait parce que tout le monde voulait faire la promo des L\u00e9gendes de la Table Ronde qui, vu de moi, fut un bide complet. On en arrive un moment au comble : l'auteure de LDLTR jeu \u00e9crivant des sc\u00e9narios pour Pendragon ! Mais si tard... Pendragon est m\u00e9connu en France et LDLTR est tomb\u00e9 dans l'oubli. Pourquoi avoir gard\u00e9 des pages sur les wargames ? Il y avait des lecteurs ? Et la pub... Mon dieu, tant de pubs... Au final, quand on se tape tous les Casus premi\u00e8re mouture, on comprend comment, petit \u00e0 petit, le public a fui. Sur certains num\u00e9ros, il n'y a rien \u00e0 garder. Enfin, il reste des sc\u00e9narios pas mal, mais ils sont souvent des m\u00eames auteurs... 28 ao\u00fbt 2022","title":"Langue de pute"},{"location":"blog/202209/#un-ete-tranquille","text":"Bon, pas mal de choses : Je poursuis la traduction de Troika! avec une approche un peu personnelle des illustrations.

En effet, le jet de plusieurs d\u00e9s donn\u00e9 des courbes en cloche (comme expliqu\u00e9 ici . Quid donc de l'intersection de deux courbes en cloches d\u00e9cal\u00e9e d'un ou plusieurs d\u00e9s ? Intuitivement, la courbe en cloche \u00e9tant : centr\u00e9e sur sa moyenne, ayant des parties basses et hautes aux tr\u00e8s faibles probabilit\u00e9s, on peut penser que le d\u00e9calage d'un seul d\u00e9 rend le combat statistiquement improbable \u00e0 gagner. (fait avec https://anydice.com) La d\u00e9formation de ces courbes est tellement importante que des seuils \u00e9lev\u00e9s sont presque inaccessible pour des PJs ayant beaucoup de d\u00e9s dans leur \"pool\". Pour autant, il ne semble pas simple de trouver sur Internet de vrais calculs de probabilit\u00e9s mettant en sc\u00e8ne des joueurs ayant des pools de d\u00e9s distincts et combattant l'un contre l'autre. Premier calcul # L'image ci-dessus montre le premier onglet du tableur LibreOffice nD6.ods . Dans ce tableur, les probabilit\u00e9s des diff\u00e9rents jets sont propos\u00e9s et, en dessous, des calculs manuels de probabilit\u00e9 de chance de combat pour divers types de combats. Comme il n'est pas simple de calculer les probabilit\u00e9s de \"8D6\" mettons, nous avons fait un petit programme Javascript pour le calculer : proba.js. $ node proba.js Usage: > node proba [number] [faces] 'number' and 'faces' must be integers Exemple d'utilisation pour 5d6 : $ node proba.js 5 6 [...] 5,100.00% 6,99.99% 7,99.92% 8,99.73% 9,99.28% 10,98.38% 11,96.76% 12,94.12% 13,90.20% 14,84.80% 15,77.85% 16,69.48% 17,60.03% 18,50.00% 19,39.97% 20,30.52% 21,22.15% 22,15.20% 23,9.80% 24,5.88% 25,3.24% 26,1.62% 27,0.72% 28,0.27% 29,0.08% 30,0.01% Le tableau donn\u00e9 est celui des probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s du lancer. Calculer les probabilit\u00e9s de gagner en combat xd6 contre yd6 # La premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 constater est que les probabilit\u00e9s ne sont pas exactement sym\u00e9triques entre les deux joueurs. C'est \u00e9trange mais c'est normal. Supposons que le premier joueur ait 3d6 et le second 4d6 : le premier joueur lancera sur un intervalle de 3-18 soit 16 possibilit\u00e9s, alors que le second joueur lancera sur un intervalle de 4-24 soit 21 possibilit\u00e9s. La m\u00e9thode prise pour ce calcul est la suivante : il s'agit de regarder tous les scores possible du joueur \u00e0 xd6 et \u00e0 calculer ses probabilit\u00e9s de gagner sur un jeu de son adversaire. Nous allons donc multiplier les probabilit\u00e9 du joueur 1 \u00e0 xd6 de faire un score n avec les probabilit\u00e9s pour le joueur 2 \u00e0 yd6 de faire \"plus\" que n . Nous avons pris deux options pour le \"plus\": le plus ou \u00e9gal et le plus strict. Pour cela, un second petit programme a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit : proba-versus.js. $ node proba-versus.js Usage: > node proba [number1] [faces1] [number2] [faces2] 'number' and 'faces' must be integers Exemple d'utilisation, 3d6 contre 4d6 : $ node proba-versus.js 3 6 4 6 [...] --- Seen from fighter 1: strict WIN, loose or equal --- TN = 3 - Win = 0.00% - Loose = 0.46% TN = 4 - Win = 0.00% - Loose = 1.39% TN = 5 - Win = 0.00% - Loose = 2.78% TN = 6 - Win = 0.02% - Loose = 4.61% TN = 7 - Win = 0.08% - Loose = 6.86% TN = 8 - Win = 0.26% - Loose = 9.46% TN = 9 - Win = 0.63% - Loose = 10.95% TN = 10 - Win = 1.22% - Loose = 11.28% TN = 11 - Win = 1.99% - Loose = 10.51% TN = 12 - Win = 2.77% - Loose = 8.81% TN = 13 - Win = 3.26% - Loose = 6.46% TN = 14 - Win = 3.08% - Loose = 3.86% TN = 15 - Win = 2.58% - Loose = 2.05% TN = 16 - Win = 1.85% - Loose = 0.93% TN = 17 - Win = 1.06% - Loose = 0.33% TN = 18 - Win = 0.39% - Loose = 0.07% WIN = 19.17% - LOOSE = 80.83% 100.00% --- Seen from fighter 1: win or equal, strict loose --- TN = 3 - Win = 0.00% - Loose = 0.46% TN = 4 - Win = 0.00% - Loose = 1.39% TN = 5 - Win = 0.01% - Loose = 2.77% TN = 6 - Win = 0.05% - Loose = 4.58% TN = 7 - Win = 0.19% - Loose = 6.76% TN = 8 - Win = 0.53% - Loose = 9.20% TN = 9 - Win = 1.13% - Loose = 10.45% TN = 10 - Win = 1.99% - Loose = 10.51% TN = 11 - Win = 2.99% - Loose = 9.51% TN = 12 - Win = 3.88% - Loose = 7.69% TN = 13 - Win = 4.31% - Loose = 5.41% TN = 14 - Win = 3.86% - Loose = 3.08% TN = 15 - Win = 3.08% - Loose = 1.55% TN = 16 - Win = 2.11% - Loose = 0.66% TN = 17 - Win = 1.17% - Loose = 0.22% TN = 18 - Win = 0.42% - Loose = 0.05% WIN = 25.72% - LOOSE = 74.28% 100.00% Synth\u00e8se # En synth\u00e8se, le tableur LibreOffice nD6.ods propose une vision synth\u00e9tique des probabilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9ussite de xd6 contre yd6. Comme nous le voyons, ces probabilit\u00e9s sont fixes. Il faut lire le tableau de la mani\u00e8re suivante : le premier joueur est en colonnes et le tableau indique son pourcentage de chances de gagner contre les diff\u00e9rents scores des adversaires (en ligne). La figure ci-dessus montre les deux m\u00eames tables en courbes.

Nous pouvons y voir deux avantages : - Une correction d'environ 50% du biais n\u00e9gatif caus\u00e9 par la m\u00e9canique 3D6 au dessus d'un seuil ; - Il reste, de plus 7% de chances environ de faire 18+ au tirage. Conclusion : de fait, le wild die est une technique int\u00e9ressante et amusante mais il ne corrige pas compl\u00e8tement les d\u00e9fauts de lancer un grand nombre de D6 pour d\u00e9passer des seuils.","title":"Introduction du \"wild die\""},{"location":"pages/D6-TargetNumber/#autres-systemes-de-jeux-aux-probabilites-lineaires","text":"Les deux plus grands syst\u00e8mes de JDR, D&D et Basic Role Playing System (CoC, Runequest, etc.), n'ont pas les d\u00e9fauts des syst\u00e8mes D6 \u00e0 seuils : - Le syst\u00e8me D&D qui est construit sur =1D20 + modificateurs > AC ou DC= est un syst\u00e8me lin\u00e9aire ; - Le syst\u00e8me Basic RPS qui est construit sur des pourcentages, =jet sous une comp\u00e9tence=, est aussi un syst\u00e8me lin\u00e9aire.

Ces solutions m\u00e9ritent un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9. Historique # La vague PbtA a commenc\u00e9 par des discussions sur le forum The Forge . En quelque sorte, PbtA est la troisi\u00e8me it\u00e9ration d'un mod\u00e8le th\u00e9orique du jeu de r\u00f4les , les deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tant : En 1997, le Threefold model (Dramatist, Gamist, Simulationist), apparu sur un forum de discussions, Entre 1999 et 2005, la GNS Theory (Gamism, Narrativism, Simulationism), port\u00e9e par un gourou, Ron Edwards . Ces mod\u00e8les conceptuels du jeu de r\u00f4le, relativement \u00e9troits car tri-dimensionnels, ont nourri une r\u00e9flexion permettant la construction d'autres types de jeux. La vague PbtA est, aujourd'hui, la grande vainqueur de cette histoire. Caract\u00e9ristiques critiqu\u00e9es sur les JDR \"anciens\" # Voici quelques uns des arguments que l'on trouve sur les forums concernant le pourquoi de la vague PbtA et les limitations des jeux anciens. Complexit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles # Les r\u00e8gles sont trop complexes, trop simulationnistes, trop sp\u00e9cifiques (une r\u00e8gle diff\u00e9rente par cas sans unit\u00e9 globale), trop incoh\u00e9rentes (pas de ligne directrice globale), trop \"crunchy\" comme disent les am\u00e9ricains. Les r\u00e8gles des anciens jeux font trop appel \u00e0 des lancers de d\u00e9s incessants, et \u00e0 des modificateurs qui s'empilent de mani\u00e8re complexe, \u00e0 des centaines de pages de r\u00e8gles. Directivit\u00e9 du MJ # Le MJ est trop directif et il ne met pas en place un univers collaboratif o\u00f9 les joueurs peuvent co-construire l'univers avec lui au travers de l'utilisation de la discussion. Pr\u00e9paration du jeu # Le temps de pr\u00e9paration est trop long, trop important, pour les anciens jeux. L'investissement du MJ est trop important. L'investissement demand\u00e9 n'est plus adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 notre monde moderne, que ce soit pour le MJ ou pour les joueurs. Derri\u00e8re cette pr\u00e9occupation mat\u00e9rielle, on retrouve la co-construction de l'histoire et une volont\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er une /dynamique organique/ du jeu. Le jeu se d\u00e9velopperait \"de lui-m\u00eame\" et n'aurait donc pas besoin de guidelines voire de sc\u00e9narios men\u00e9s par un MJ ayant tout p\u00e9par\u00e9 seul. Non int\u00e9graion des derni\u00e8res techniques de jeu # Certaines variantes de jeu ont permis de voir les choses diff\u00e9remment (JDR solo avec \"gamemaster emulator\", JDR sans MJ, etc.) et de pousser les jeux \"narratifs\" et co-construits sur le devant de la sc\u00e8ne. Les anciens jeux n'ont pas inclus ces nouvelles tendances. Des arguments anciens # Les arguments critiques envers les jeux tr\u00e8s lourds en r\u00e8gles (\u00e0 commencer par D&D) \u00e9taient \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames, durant les ann\u00e9es 80/90. La recherche du Graal du jeu bas\u00e9 sur le roleplay et avec tr\u00e8s peu de r\u00e8gles a longtemps occup\u00e9 les colonnes des magazines de JDR. de nombreuses tentatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, sans \u00eatre vraiment couronn\u00e9es de succ\u00e8s. Un nouveau type de jeu # Apocalypse World, le premier jeu de la vague PbtA sort de 2010, soit plus de 20 ans apr\u00e8s ces d\u00e9bats. La famille Baker, qui a design\u00e9 ce jeu, est une famille de quadras \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Nourris par The Forge et la GNS, ils proposent un nouveau type de jeu. Une modification profonde de la vision des PJs # L'avant : des PJs \u00e0 base de chiffres # La premi\u00e8re composante du JDR traditionnel est la composante PJ. Selon comment ces derniers sont structur\u00e9s, les joueurs auront plus ou moins de possibilit\u00e9s. Les r\u00e8gles du jeu organisent les interactions entre les PJ et le monde, ainsi qu'avec les PNJs. Les jeux de r\u00f4les de la premi\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration (D&D, Cthulhu, GURPS, Rolemaster, etc.) sont bas\u00e9s sur une possibilit\u00e9 de comparaison objective entre les PJs, et sur un calibrage des PJs par rapport \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 du monde. Ainsi, dans la plupart des jeux, on trouve, d\u00e9crit en termes de jeu, les principaux animaux. Etablir une \u00e9chelle objective permet aussi de construire et de dimensionner des adversaires PNJ. Certains jeux comme D&D utiliseront la notion de niveau (voir quelques commentaires sur D&D ). Des PJs plus ou moins structur\u00e9s avec des mots ou des expressions # Avec l'apparition de jeux comme Fudge (1992), un \"pont\" est dress\u00e9 entre des valeurs sous forme de nombre (de -3 \u00e0 +3) et des descriptifs qualificatifs portant cette \"valeur\". M\u00eame si la m\u00e9canique sous-jacente est encore \u00e0 base de nombres et de modificateurs, les mots vont prendre progressivement une importance \u00e9norme dans le monde des JDR, jusqu'\u00e0 prendre la place d'attributs, de comp\u00e9tences, de dons, de d\u00e9fauts ou m\u00eame de pouvoirs. Les mots s'imposent dans les cr\u00e9ations des PJs au travers des \"aspects\", des \"clich\u00e9s\", des \"arch\u00e9types\", des \"avatars\", des \"concepts de personnages\", etc. Ces mots peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s durant le jeu pour appeler une m\u00e9canique particuli\u00e8re, le plus souvent un bonus ou une comp\u00e9tence impliqu\u00e9e par ou \"sous-entendue\" dans l'expression elle-m\u00eame. Or, au travers de cette irruption des mots dans les m\u00e9caniques des JDR, les probl\u00e8mes relatifs \u00e0 l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 des mots et des expressions entrent dans le monde du JDR. Des PJs non structur\u00e9s dans des jeux pour v\u00e9t\u00e9rans ? # Il faut une certaine exp\u00e9rience du JDR pour pouvoir d\u00e9finir des /mots et expressions utiles/ au jeu. En un sens, le JDR s'adresse implicitement \u00e0 des v\u00e9t\u00e9rans, voire \u00e0 des v\u00e9t\u00e9rans dans un mode jeu ironique (voire cynique). Ces derniers ont les codes du JDR : ils sauront quelle expression leur permet de \"joueur comme \u00e0 AD&D\". Le discours est que les jeux utilisant des mots rendent le JDR plus accessible aux d\u00e9butants. Etant donn\u00e9 que la logique du jeu est plus complexe \u00e0 comprendre, car souvent implicite, cette assertion n'est pas facilement d\u00e9fendable. Incertitude autour des PJ et des PNJ # Les mots ou phrases introduisent une incertitude autour des personnages , incertitude \u00e0 laquelle le MJ doit s'adapter. En effet, les mots sont vagues, soumis \u00e0 des interpr\u00e9tations et parfois en recouvrement s\u00e9mantique partiel, ce qui rend compliqu\u00e9 leur usage. Cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 est vue comme positive par les tenants de cette m\u00e9canique. Elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie clairement aux joueurs en d\u00e9poss\u00e9dant le MJ d'une partie de ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Les mots et les phrases descriptives des PJ et PNJ introduisent aussi une incertitude dans l'\u00e9quilibre des PJ entre eux et avec les PNJ , et donc une possibilit\u00e9 d'arbitraire pour les MJ. Il devient, en effet, complexe de quantifier les expressions pour \u00e9quilibrer les personnages et les aventures. Favoriser les extravertis # Les mots et les phrases favorisent les joueurs extravertis qui pourront interpr\u00e9ter de mani\u00e8re libre un \"clich\u00e9\" alors que les introvertis seront desservis par des r\u00e8gles bas\u00e9es sur des mots et sur le besoin d'improviser oralement pour les interpr\u00e9ter. Dans les jeux classiques, les joueurs utilisent des \u00e9chelles objectives, ce qui permet \u00e0 tous d'avoir une \u00e9chelle commune pour s'exprimer. Deux types de MJ # Les jeux \u00e0 base de mots sont des jeux tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifiques dans lesquels le MJ doit investir pour comprendre comment utiliser ces mots ou expressions plus ou moins libres et plus ou moins contraintes par le game designer. Cet investissement est souvent li\u00e9 \u00e0 la recherche d'un m\u00e9canisme ressemblant \u00e0 une \u00e9chelle objective. D'autres MJ, en revanche, se satisferont du c\u00f4t\u00e9 plus \"libre\" d'un jeu bas\u00e9 sur les mots et sur les interpr\u00e9tations des joueurs et du MJ. Le fait de moins structurer les personnages, qu'ils soient joueurs ou non, permet de laisser place \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation et \u00e0 la co-cr\u00e9ation du jeu. Les PJ ne sont pas dans un monde de r\u00e8gles objectives qui les contraint, ils sont \"racont\u00e9s\" par le MJ et les joueurs. Peut-\u00eatre est-on face \u00e0 deux types de MJ : des MJ scientifiques aimant les \u00e9chelles absolues et les MJ litt\u00e9raires aimant l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 des mots. La structuration du \"backgound\" des personnages # Le JDR narratif apporte une obsession \u00e9trange : celle de la structuration du background. Dans la plupart des jeux anciens, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un background \u00e0 son personnage, cela \u00e9tait plus ou moins fait, et disons que le background s'enrichissait au fur et \u00e0 mesure des parties. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, m\u00eame dans les jeux modernes, les aventures pass\u00e9es des PJ devenaient rapidement leur backgound principal. Beaucoup de jeux plus r\u00e9cents \u00e9tablissent une vraie dictature du background en exigeant de le structurer de mani\u00e8re sch\u00e9matique voire caricaturale, en termes de jeu. Ainsi, on voit appara\u00eetre, en plus de la notion de \"clich\u00e9\" ou d'\"arch\u00e9type\" : Une certaine obsession pour les d\u00e9fauts des PJ , souvent utiles pour gagner des points dans le processus de cr\u00e9ation, parfois obligatoires dans le processus, souvent en contrepartie des dons ; Des contacts sociaux obligatoires, Un ennemi jur\u00e9 obligatoire, Etc. Cette sch\u00e9matisation \u00e0 outrance du background des personnages concourt \u00e0 en faire des caricatures, semblant \u00eatre issues du m\u00eame moule, et \u00e0 rendre suffocant l'univers des personnages. Dans une conception ancienne, le PJ doit \u00eatre libre avant tout et n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre \"backgroundis\u00e9\" arbitrairement au travers de dimensions caricaturales. Ce sujet est d\u00e9licat, car il s'agit d'un probl\u00e8me de curseur. La structuration du background des personnages a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 un sujet dans le JDR, mais dans des jeux comme PbtA, il semble que le bouchon soit pouss\u00e9 plus loin. Les playbooks : des caricatures de classes de PJ ? # La notion de classe ne dispara\u00eet pas dans les jeux de type PbtA, on pourrait m\u00eame dire qu'elle s'hyper-sp\u00e9cialise. Au travers des \"playbooks\", il est difficile de savoir si l'on joue un personnage pr\u00e9tir\u00e9 ou un personnage d'une classe de personnage tr\u00e8s \"\u00e9troite\". D'autant qu'au sein d'une partie, un seul personnage d'un certain type ne peut \u00eatre jou\u00e9 dans le groupe. Le besoin de customiser le playbook est donc limit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plus simple expression, car le personnage est d\u00e9j\u00e0 si sp\u00e9cifique, qu'il ne m\u00e9rite qu'un \"acteur\" pour l'incarner. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, la logique des playbooks \u00e9quivaut, pour les jeux plus anciens, \u00e0 une logique de personnages pr\u00e9tir\u00e9s. Garantir la bonne r\u00e9partition des r\u00f4les implique, tout comme dans D&D, \u00e9quilibrer un groupe pour une aventure. Des caricatures de PJ pour un petit univers ? # Si l'on m\u00e8le description textuelle et playbooks, nous voyons un JDR o\u00f9 les personnages ont tendance \u00e0 \u00eatre des caricatures. La volont\u00e9 de jouer des caricatures semble clairement influenc\u00e9e par : Les films et s\u00e9ries, Les jeux vid\u00e9os, Les comics et les mangas. Or, jouer des caricatures ou des arch\u00e9types de personnages de films ou de BD offre, pour certains joueurs et MJ, des possibilit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es. Ou disons que cette approche permet de jouer des aventures ressemblant \u00e0 des films ou des s\u00e9ries, mais sur des styles souvent tr\u00e8s \u00e9troits, voire vraiment tr\u00e8s \u00e9troits. Cette r\u00e9duction de l'univers de jeu semble une caract\u00e9ristique des jeux PbtA. Les PJ arch\u00e9typaux \u00e9voluent dans un monde restreint, arch\u00e9typal, dans une niche ou une sous-niche. Notons que cette caract\u00e9ristique implique la multiplication des jeux, nous y reviendrons. Dans des jeux plus traditionnels, les r\u00e8gles permettent de g\u00e9rer l'univers de jeu qui, par nature, est vaste, voire - on aime \u00e0 le penser - infini. La partie \"libert\u00e9 des personnages \u00e0 interagir avec le reste du monde\" est une dimension importante du jeu de r\u00f4les, d'o\u00f9 les cartes des mondes avec des d\u00e9tails \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9chelles. Le MJ est garant de ce monde qui, en aucun cas, ne serait se limit\u00e9 aux quelques arch\u00e9types du genre. Le fait m\u00eame qu'il soit vaste laisse le champ pour la surprise et pour l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des campagnes. Le style m\u00eame des aventures peut changer d'une aventure \u00e0 l'autre. Si une aventure est ax\u00e9e sur l'exploration et les combats, une seconde peut \u00eatre une enqu\u00eate et une troisi\u00e8me peut avoir un sc\u00e9nario de film d'horreur. En fait, c'est comme si les jeux de super-h\u00e9ros avaient gagn\u00e9 en esprit sur certains JDR : il semble qu'il faille jouer des caricatures standardis\u00e9es dans les jeux modernes, des personnages de s\u00e9rie t\u00e9l\u00e9, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement fabriqu\u00e9s pour \u00e9voluer dans un certain genre de s\u00e9ries tr\u00e8s \u00e9troit (sous-genre ou sous-sous-genre). Les \"move\" # Si les PJs ont chang\u00e9 dans des jeux PbtA, les m\u00e9caniques de jeu aussi. Dans certains jeux relativement r\u00e9cents, les mots sont utilis\u00e9s pour les \"move\", des genres d'actions g\u00e9n\u00e9riques que les PJ peuvent faire, ces actions \u00e9tant adapt\u00e9es au sous-genre propos\u00e9 par le jeu. Le game designer impose, en plus de tout ce que nous avons vu, une certaine mani\u00e8re de jouer les personnages en d\u00e9terminant les \"move\" par type de personnage, pour tous les types, ainsi que pour le MJ. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, ces moves sont sp\u00e9cifiques au jeu, peu faciles \u00e0 comprendre et \u00e0 utiliser, et en recouvrement s\u00e9mantique les uns avec les autres (ce qui est souvent volontaire). Si l'on examine finement des jeux comme Apocalypse World , on se rend compte que les moves des PJ et du MC (Master of Ceremony, un genre de \"MJ light et collaboratif\") semblent se r\u00e9pondre et avoir fait l'objet de simulations par ordinateur. En contraignant les actions possibles des PJ, et en cat\u00e9gorisant les diff\u00e9rentes actions possibles du MC, le jeu donne l'impression de mettre en place une chor\u00e9graphie bien adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 certains jeux ou univers, mais au final tr\u00e8s m\u00e9caniste, et dont les r\u00e9sultats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \"optimis\u00e9s\" dans des simulateurs inaccessibles aux joueurs et au MJ. Certes, le jeu poss\u00e8de une certaine dynamique organique dont nous parlions auparavant, et donc fournit les effets promis. Mais cela est rendu possible au travers des encha\u00eenements de moves entre PJ et MC, ces derni\u00e8res ayant fait l'objet de simulations informatis\u00e9es ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es dans le game design. Les moves ne sont donc pas des vraies comp\u00e9tences, mais plus, comme leur nom l'indique, des actions appelant d'autres moves. Le glissement s\u00e9mantique est subtil, mais r\u00e9el : dans une situation, l'utilisation d'un move appelle un autre move \"compatible\" en face, et donc restreint m\u00e9caniquement les possibilit\u00e9s de jeu, en favorisant des \"mod\u00e8les d'action\" ( action patterns ) arch\u00e9typaux au genre ou sous-genre consid\u00e9r\u00e9. Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et jeu de plateau # Nous sommes donc devant une nouvelle cat\u00e9gorie de jeux ayant les caract\u00e9ristiques suivantes : Les personnages sont des arch\u00e9types (playbook) aux actions arch\u00e9typales (move). Pour les anciens r\u00f4listes, ce sont des \"personnages pr\u00e9tir\u00e9s\". Les playbooks vont au del\u00e0 des classes de personnages de D&D pour qui la classe est un moyen de progresser dans une certaine voie. Les aventures sont \u00e9tudi\u00e9es et optimis\u00e9es pour ces arch\u00e9types ayant ces actions arch\u00e9typales. Le joueur doit endosser l'arch\u00e9type, jouer le personnage pr\u00e9tir\u00e9 et utiliser ses actions (move) pr\u00e9d\u00e9finis. S'il ne le joue pas, l'histoire et sa dynamique peuvent \u00eatre perturb\u00e9es. Nous sommes donc dans une perspective plus th\u00e9\u00e2trale que libre, un th\u00e9\u00e2tre aux dimensions contraintes par le game designer. Le canevas impos\u00e9 aux joueurs semble plus dur que le canevas impos\u00e9 par les anciens jeux. Retour au jeu de plateau # Si les moves devenaient des cartes physiques et les playbooks des fiches cartonn\u00e9es, nous pourrions \u00eatre dans un jeu de plateau, type jeu de strat\u00e9gie. Une sc\u00e8ne devient alors une s\u00e9rie de cartes \u00e0 action que chaque jouer abat \u00e0 son tour (PJ et MC ou PJ et PJ). Chaque joueur aurait une s\u00e9rie de moves sous forme de cartes, ainsi que le MC. Chacun abat ses cartes en r\u00e9action aux actions de l'autre. Certaines r\u00e9actions sont faisables et d'autres inadapt\u00e9es. Les jeux de type PbtA ne sont donc pas des JDR classiques mais ressemblent plus \u00e0 des jeux hybrides entre jeu de r\u00f4le, jeu de cartes (genre Magic the Gathering) et jeu de plateau. L'\u00e9ternel retour # Au travers des jeux PbtA, le JDR vit donc, au sens strict du terme, une \"r\u00e9gression\" : l\u00e0 o\u00f9 Gary Gygax avait sorti le jeu de r\u00f4les du monde du jeu de plateau de strat\u00e9gie, PbtA nous ram\u00e8ne vers le jeu de plateau avec les m\u00eames buts : Cr\u00e9er un jeu optimis\u00e9 pour un sous-genre, voire un sous-sous-genre ; Cr\u00e9er des arch\u00e9types de personnages taill\u00e9s pour le sous-genre et aux actions limit\u00e9es pour ob\u00e9ir aux r\u00e8gles du sous-genre (dans l'esprit d'une \"s\u00e9rie\") ; Contraindre les joueurs et le MJ \u00e0 \u00e9voluer dans un narratif qui contraint les PJ dans une sandbox, dans un univers de possibles limit\u00e9s, o\u00f9 les moves ont \u00e9t\u00e9 optimis\u00e9s pour cr\u00e9er m\u00e9caniquement une dynamique de jeu organique. Une des cons\u00e9quences est le c\u00f4t\u00e9 parfois extr\u00eamement brutal ou exp\u00e9ditif du jeu, cela de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s surprenante pour les pratiquants des anciens JDR. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 les anciens JDR proposaient des approches plus progressives (difficult\u00e9s pour les joueurs \u00e0 mesurer les risques d'une action, m\u00e9canique d'aggravation des situations suite \u00e0 \u00e9chec, etc.), tout peut basculer tr\u00e8s vite dans le monde PbtA. En fait, ce genre de jeux est tout \u00e0 fait pertinent et il est normal qu'il s\u00e9duise un certain public. Mais il est aussi normal que d'autres joueurs ne l'appr\u00e9cient pas, car c'est un autre type de jeu.","title":"Analyse des jeux PbtA"},{"location":"pages/pbta/#historique","text":"La vague PbtA a commenc\u00e9 par des discussions sur le forum The Forge .

En contraignant les actions possibles des PJ, et en cat\u00e9gorisant les diff\u00e9rentes actions possibles du MC, le jeu donne l'impression de mettre en place une chor\u00e9graphie bien adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 certains jeux ou univers, mais au final tr\u00e8s m\u00e9caniste, et dont les r\u00e9sultats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \"optimis\u00e9s\" dans des simulateurs inaccessibles aux joueurs et au MJ. Certes, le jeu poss\u00e8de une certaine dynamique organique dont nous parlions auparavant, et donc fournit les effets promis. Mais cela est rendu possible au travers des encha\u00eenements de moves entre PJ et MC, ces derni\u00e8res ayant fait l'objet de simulations informatis\u00e9es ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es dans le game design. Les moves ne sont donc pas des vraies comp\u00e9tences, mais plus, comme leur nom l'indique, des actions appelant d'autres moves. Le glissement s\u00e9mantique est subtil, mais r\u00e9el : dans une situation, l'utilisation d'un move appelle un autre move \"compatible\" en face, et donc restreint m\u00e9caniquement les possibilit\u00e9s de jeu, en favorisant des \"mod\u00e8les d'action\" ( action patterns ) arch\u00e9typaux au genre ou sous-genre consid\u00e9r\u00e9.","title":"Les \"move\""},{"location":"pages/pbta/#theatre-et-jeu-de-plateau","text":"Nous sommes donc devant une nouvelle cat\u00e9gorie de jeux ayant les caract\u00e9ristiques suivantes : Les personnages sont des arch\u00e9types (playbook) aux actions arch\u00e9typales (move). Pour les anciens r\u00f4listes, ce sont des \"personnages pr\u00e9tir\u00e9s\". Les playbooks vont au del\u00e0 des classes de personnages de D&D pour qui la classe est un moyen de progresser dans une certaine voie. Les aventures sont \u00e9tudi\u00e9es et optimis\u00e9es pour ces arch\u00e9types ayant ces actions arch\u00e9typales. Le joueur doit endosser l'arch\u00e9type, jouer le personnage pr\u00e9tir\u00e9 et utiliser ses actions (move) pr\u00e9d\u00e9finis. S'il ne le joue pas, l'histoire et sa dynamique peuvent \u00eatre perturb\u00e9es. Nous sommes donc dans une perspective plus th\u00e9\u00e2trale que libre, un th\u00e9\u00e2tre aux dimensions contraintes par le game designer.

Une sc\u00e8ne devient alors une s\u00e9rie de cartes \u00e0 action que chaque jouer abat \u00e0 son tour (PJ et MC ou PJ et PJ). Chaque joueur aurait une s\u00e9rie de moves sous forme de cartes, ainsi que le MC. Chacun abat ses cartes en r\u00e9action aux actions de l'autre. Certaines r\u00e9actions sont faisables et d'autres inadapt\u00e9es.
