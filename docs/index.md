## What's that?

This blog is an attempt to define an **ironic enterprise RPG**, enabling you, amongst other things, to:

* Simulate your colleagues;
* Anticipate the results of confrontations and meetings;
* Forecast who will be promoted next.

This game is a work-in-progress and will probably require a set of RPG D&D compatible dices like the following ones.
