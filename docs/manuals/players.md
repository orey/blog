# Players Handbook

## Traits

Every player has some traits, some of them freely chosen and some of them imposed. Traits value is expressed with a number of D6.

Values :

* Low is 1D6.
* Average is 2D6.
* Expert > 4D6.

## Imposed traits

Traits :

* Physical
* Intellect
* Feeling

You have to spread 7D6 on those 3 traits.

The following table shows caricatures.

Characteristic | Manual Worker | Engineer | Marketing
--- | --- | --- | ---
Physical  | 4D6 | 2D6 | 1D6
Intellect | 2D6 | 4D6 | 3D6
Feeling   | 1D6 | 1D6 | 3D6 

Other traits can proceed from those ones. Depending on the situations, the players will have to test Intellect or Feeling.

## Spells

Managers know how to cast some spells. The notion of saving throws is very adapted for that.

Some skills should influence on saving throws with bonuses. Low skills should provide a penalty for saving throws.
