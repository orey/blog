GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright \u00a9 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.

A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.

There seem to be a way to open comments in this blog but I am not sure many people will be interested by the topic. If you are, contact me by mail. A long time ago, I played RPGs, mainly CoC, Warhammer, Parano\u00efa, Vampire, Kult, but also French games like Mega II , Bitume , Empire et Dynasties ou L\u00e9gendes . I was never a player of D&D. Recently, I have entered the RPG world again and try to catch up, especially with all the SRD and Open Gaming adventure. That initiative created PathFinder as a competitor to D&D. I'm reading some other rule books inheritated from the SRD 3.5, especially Basic Fantasy RPG , and OSRIC . Indeed, as I like the D20 system in general, I would like to inspire the Enterprise RPG gaming system from it. The fact is I find it very surprising that there seem to be no dodge or parrying system. In a round (let's says 10 seconds), I would have expected every PC to have at least 1 attack and 1 defense. For sure, the order in the combat sequence is depending upon initiative, which means that if you don't have the initiative, you can try to parry (with your shield or your weapon - BTW, weapon parrying power depends on the weapon because a stick is not a sword) or to dodge. Dodging should be the result of DEX and so have some bonus/malus coming from DEX and some bonus/malus coming from AC (it is more complex to dodge with a plate armor than without). Concerning parrying, it could be done at the same level that the attack, or to be some kind of contest versus the attack of the attacker. However, you should choose to parry with your shield or your weapon. For sure, I think the AC concept theoretically takes into account this fact, but I think it breaks the balance in combat. Let us suppose you are a Monk at level 12: You should be unreachable my most creatures, even if you don't attack and you just dodge. The fact of having 2 attacks per round would give you the same number of defenses. I even think you should be able to turn the attack in a defense if you need it, for instance when attacked by multiple enemies. I have to continue my investigations to see how dodge and parrying are treated in other rule books. I am not really in favor of dodging being a skill: it should be more part of the core combat system. I have to reply on a logical combat system that's why those investigations are interesting. August 30 Spells, classes and armor class Courtesys of sirdrak Spells Some enterprise PCs have Charism but not only. They are able to seduce people even if their real skills are low. On the contrary, many people can be charmed by those spells, above all if they are not skilled enough to realize the subterfuge. Skills should influence on saving throws with bonuses. Low skills should provide a malus for saving throws. Anyway, the seduction should be considered as a magic power. Magic could be based on Charisma. Classes of characters Indeed, as all PCs are human (are they really? ;), there are no races. But classes of characters also exist. The Classes should match basic profile characteristics. Engineer could be a profile. Salesman or saleswoman another. HR, Marketing, Finance, etc. could be classes. Classically, PC classes should require some level in a certain characteristic. The belonging of a certain \"influence cycle\" should be possible. In France, ENA, X or ENSAM are acting like secret societies that create networks of people assigning themselves positions without them to be always connected to their real skills. That belonging could add some bonus or malus in different situations. Armor class Generally the boss of a company will have a very low armor class. If the business is owned by him, the AC is 1. But for companies where the boss is just a nominated guy, which means he can be replaced, the his AC should be 2 or 3. For the rest of people, their AC should be the boss AC minus the number of hierarchical levels between the boss and the PC position. For instance, let us suppose your PC is the n-5 of a big boss who has an AC=2. Your AC is 7. Note: PC should have AC modifiers depending on the situations. August 27 Create funny rolls If characteristics are balanced between one extreme and the other, for several situations, it would be quite funny to let the GM decide what \"side\" of the characteristics to roll for. One alternative is to make 2 rolls. I have to think about it. August 27 More characteristics and skills Let's go straight to the point: many characteristics and skills in Enterprise-RPG must represent the bad reality of companies. Let's try a first list: Characteristic or skill? Type Comment Lying Skill Could be attached to some alignment notion Politics Characteristic Lying could be a skill deriving Physical Characteristic Not so useful Technical skills Skills Per domain Sell Skill Can be used in other contexts Invent stupid project Skill This should probably be generalized to other stupid stuff Misunderstand Skill A good skill for manager is misunderstanding Paranoia Skill Ability to imagine that someone is plotting agains you Plot Skill A useful skill in enterprise Detect Plot Skill Same Bad faith Skill Same A lot of skills should find their places in \"combat rules\". First Ideas About Combat Rules Combat rules could have several flavours: Confrontation: face to face Group combat: influence in a meeting, groupe versus group, etc. Plot August 26 Characteristics Courtesy of istockphoto.com First inspiration: Jung Each character will have a set of characteristics and skills. I like the skills being specialization of characteristics. I wanted to start with the Jungiang traits. Roughly, Jung defines 3 kinds of attributes. If we adopt the perspective of Myers-Briggs (without adding the 4th trait), we can have: Introversion/Extraversion, which is the place from where people are taking their energy; Intuitive/Sensing, which is the perception of time, intuitive living in the future and being able to anticipate, and sensing living in the present; Thinkful/Feeling, which is the approach of conflict, or based on intellectual facts or based on feeling for people. In all cases, as the \"context\" (understand \"the enterprise the PC are into\") requires certain details on the \"mind characteristics\", we have to find a way to have balanced characteristics. First rules Let's take an example to enable to reflection. Sandra is a woman and she has an argument with Vincent, a man. Vincent is \"Feel\" oriented whereas Sandra is more \"Think\". Let us suppose that we have just one scale: Feel + Think should be a fixed number and Sandra would have much more chances to succeed in an analysis based on Think than an analysis based on Feel (and the reverse for Vincent). However: Those characteristics should both exist in both profiles and be linked together in some way; There is no reason for which those characteristics may be limited. So we can imagine the following rules: For your PC, at PC creation, you have one roll for Think/Feel: roll 3D6 to get X; Choose if X goes to Feel or to Think; Put 18-X in the other characteristic. The result would be for Sandra 3+6+4=13: Characteristic Feel Think Value 5 13 And for Vincent, 1+4+5=10: Characteristic Feel Think Value 10 8 This can enable the standard D20 roll against some threshold to succeed to not in a certain challenge. August 25 What kind of dice? Courtesy of istockphoto.com The first point will be to decide what kind of dice use. I admit having a preference for standard RPG dices, and not D6, even if most of the quick tabletop RPG seem to be using D6. For now, I will adopt a game system inspired by D&D but the blog is here to enable the reflection on the topic. August 25 What is the enterprise RPG you are talking about? Courtesy of istockphoto.com The enterprise is an hostile environment in which various set of skills are employed : technical ones, but also political ones. For decades, the enterprise landscape has changed, not really for the best, especially in big structures: Political skills are, more than ever, on the frontline; Technical skills seem to stay in the background; Nowadays, who is concerned about change management, or exact reporting? This blogs starts a reflection around a simulation system that would be adapted to simulate what's going on in modern enterprises in which nothing can be called a failure anymore and everything is always a success, where intentions are too often sufficient. This in-progress game aims to turn catastrophic situations in funny situations. If the exercise is successfull, you will be able : To create the PC (Player Characters) that correspond to your collegues; To predict the output of meetings and to create various kinds of \"encounters\"; To determine who is the best PC or NPC (Non Player Character) to win a challenge or a contest; In one word, to play the roles of your colleagues. In a certain way, this system could be a RPG but would more be a way to have fun in the office with the RPG concepts adapted to the enterprise. More to come.

August 25","title":"What is the enterprise RPG you are talking about?"},{"location":"2020/202009/","text":"September 2020 D&D and the American appetite for wilderness There is something peculiar about D&D, which could explain why I am not so fond of stories of people fighting with monsters in darks labyrinths. While reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grognardia , the huge attraction for \"wilderness\", which seems at the root of D&D, is a bit foreign to me. Maybe, the reason is cultural. In France, we have a long lasting past and everyone at school studies the Middle-Age, and the Greeks and Romans before that. In a certain way, a \"dungeon\" is just the biggest tower in a castle, where the lord used to live. Chivalry, in the French unconscious, is quite different than the picture that is depicted in D&D: knights have a law code and serve the widow and the orphan. They are often in love with a lady in a romantic way. They may face magic but not in the D&D sense. In a way, the Arthurian legend remains our reference. For a European eye, D&D looks like a western in tunnels with monsters as enemies, instead of Indians. I know, this is a bit provocative, but D&D is not at all a vision of chivalry, as we have traditionally in France. On the contrary: killing monsters, conquer territories and gain treasures to gain levels look, to me, as a caricature of the American dream. | D&D element | Element of American culture | French traditional chivalry element | Element of French culture | | ----- | ----- | | Travel in the wilderness to conquer territories | This really seems as the ideal of the Far West, which is typical American culture | In French, chivalry, knight quests are for God or for a loved one. | Conquering territories is no more considered as a positive thing (colonization is seen as a bad thing) | | Fight enemies and kill monsters | The violence is part of American culture, as the fighting | The notion of \"monster\" is present in the European legends but in small doses, probably due to Catholicism | Violence is more psychological and verbal than real in French society (maybe because it is forbidden to have weapons) | | Gain treasure | Typical American culture about earthly wealth, which is also typical from protestant countries | The knights were fighting for an ideal and not for money, especially money coming from the murder and robbery of other living beings | Catholic tradition that sees money as something dirty | | Gain experience and progress in the levels | This can be seen as a real appetite for social ascension, and social competition | This appetite also exists but not really in the chivalry tradition | Social progression was also a feature of the Baby Boomers, being in the US or in Europe | In other words, D&D is a very American game: A universe where violence and murder enables to progress in the society and become more powerful... Maybe that deserves more details than this quick simplistic psycho-analysis, but that may also explain why, for many French people, D&D is not very exciting. In France, we have this expression \"Gros Bill\" (\"Big Bill\") who is supposed to represent the super-hero knight, able to massacre everyone. If I saw many Gros-Bills, I never saw them craving for wilderness. Because we are old countries, most of us don't dream about conquest of the wild countries. For sure, D&D can be played like CoC, with more atmosphere and monsters that are so powerful that your should run instead of fighting. But, discovering progressively the roots of D&D, I think I progress in my understanding of why D&D is not my cup of tea. September 15 2020 Software help for RPGs? For sure, dice are crucial to RPGs. But knowing that many role players play with tables, I am quite surprised of the \"paper orientation\" of the RPG world. It's obvious that the objective is not to create a graphical RPG, but it could be interesting, for instance, to have random tables managed digitally. Maybe my reflection is driven by some random game helps or by games like Mythic. But in some cases, being able to generate characters dynamically could be really interesting. Indeed, I am quite interested by the mix between random elements and driven elements. If we consider the old school gaming scenarios, the structure is quite often simple: A scenario introduction, with the plot (when there is a plot :), A location description, NPC (quite often monsters) and treasures description. In the case of the use of a GM emulator, easy software tools could be very interesting, something like a web page enabling to manage more complex randomness in a certain context . Interesting topic. September 10 2020 Autum's coming I like Autumn. Living in the south of France, a very hot region in Summer, Autumn is the end of Summer and so the capacity of walking in the mountains again. The period is also the period of rough storms with heavy rain, which is changing after all those months of sunny and hot days. I just received the Dungeon's Master Guide of D&D 3e. I must admit I am a bit disappointed because the book is not old school, and appears to me as overproduced, nearer from a collection object than to a usable game. But well, I am used to D&D and I must go on. September 8 2020 The big director's roll Well, I begin to play with dice at work, trying to predict what will happen. I faced today a really interesting case. Let me create the scene (maybe it is a wargame rather than a RPG): You have two teams, one is good and the other is bad. In a contract, each team wrote half of a document to present to a prospect. The overall material is bad, undoubtedly. The prospect screams saying: \"what kind of s**t is it?\" At first, the hierarchy laughs, saying : \"oh yes, no problem, everything's OK, just this stupid prospect that doesn't understand how smart we are. Well, after a while, probably after tectonic management movements (because the prospect reaction has a tendency to climb up the ladder), everyone would like to find a guilty person. For sure, the good team would be a good choice. Because, if the bad team survived, that means they have a specific protection charm that is not in line with their skills: maybe the charm is Not My Fault . So the attention gets to the good team that did a good job. The director of the bad team has a meeting tomorrow with the director of the good team. Indeed, as the team leader of the good team predicted it with his It Smells like Crap psionic power. Working from that prediction, the good team prepared the place for battle with many traps that are reinforced by the Hidden Truth potion. I calculated the odds of the bad director: 25% of being able to convince to good director, after all bonuses and penalties applied. I rolled a 98! Uh! Critical failure... We'll see tomorrow if my Oracle begins to work! September 7 2020 Getting public? For now, this blog is quite hidden, which is nice. That enables me to dig into the recent (or less recent) RPG story. I kinda like to read the various game systems and compare them. I went recently through old stuff of mine: Simulacres , for instance which is a French game as I dislike them. The game system could have been innovative, but instead it is complicated and even a bit pretentious. I really dislike this feature in French personality: bragging as if French people had invented the hot water (French expression). Nevertheless, I love France and the French. But I would like to see more really creative stuff, playable stuff, modest, optimized, efficient, creative, straight to the point stuff, than those crappy \"I am the best and I teach you\" products. In the past, many game designers have indulged the pleasure of farting higher than their asses (other French expression, rather sympathetic this one), and I dislike it. I would say that Croc is probably one of a kind, that did not, or at least I don't remember. Maybe also the one who created the French RPG where you play lycanthropes. I'll find the name back. Well, the fact is, there are many RPGs that I find unplayable, but they don't feel as if they were lecturing me on something. That's the power of Americans. There is so much competition, that people try their best to do the best product. I see also a certain kind of \"focus\" in some American games. We're here for something particular: role-playing in a certain universe, and not benefiting from that tribune to insinuate political of social-crap stuff. A game is a game and no moral lesson from your grand-pa. September 7 2020 The winning couple for a RPG starting now with no preparation? I analyzed extensively the Risus RPG (which is short so that didn't take much time) and created a flowchart to sum-up this micro-game (in French). Yes, my intention is to translate stuff when I can and when the license enables it. France is a great country for RPGs, even if I often find the French RPG a bit patronizing... As the French maybe. Anyway, in order to play without any preparation, nor at the game mechanics level, or at the scenario level, maybe the winning couple is Risus + Mythic . Risus is a funny game with very simple game mechanics, that are similar to some other mini-RPGs such as Cthulhu Dark ( French version ) or the children game FirstFable ( French version ) or even the very micro-game Roll for Shoes ( French version ). I think the emergence of mini-RPGs is the proof of some RPG players getting old. When you are young, you are keen to work hard in very large rule books. When you are older, you can run on the accumulated capacities of GM-ing that you have accumulated for so many years. The problem of older players is, for sure, the availability of other players. When everyone has its life, it's not so easy to meet. So, quite often, the sessions are scarcer, and with less players (unless you enroll your own children). For that, simple game engines can be a good way to address the rule part preparation. Remains the adventure itself for which you can use many tools: generators or even GM emulators if you really don't have the time to prepare a story. Concerning GM emulation, I think it would be great to use it inside a pre-existing universe. I have to investigate on that. September 7 2020 A very creative period It's been a long time since I did not have a look to the RPG world, almost 25 years! For sure, I discovered that a multitude of RPGs and RPG engines were created in 25 years, and some of them seem to me as particularly notable. One of them is Mythic GM Emulator . This engine defined a new way to envisage to RPG by playing adventures with a level of randomness and possibly with no GM. I will write more about that game soon. I must admit that, a long time ago, I know many players that would have been greatly satisfied with that kind of engine. This creative period is very interesting because, for the RPG player and GM, there are plenty of offers, and most of them quite affordable. Many are Creative Commons or open source, or free. There is also the dominant position of DriveThruRPG as a global dealer of RPGs. I can see many great evolutions in the RPG universe in those last years : The development of Internet enabled many independant authors to create very interesting material, very often for a limited price. The development of print on demand enabled also to differentiate the selling of PDFs from the selling of printed manuals, which is great, considering the disappearance of many gaming shops (at least in France). The SRD 3.5 opened the door to re-interpretations of old school ways of playing RPGs, which can be a good thing. Games should offer many variations and attract several kinds of players. On this topic, I started reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grogniardia . It is very intesting and enables me to catch on with the RPG world. There are some good moments, in this blog, about the old school RPG gaming, mostly based on the the 2 first editions of D&D (OD&D and Holmes mainly). Even if I was never a player of D&D, the old school is talking to me. The age, maybe. The passion for CoC also where I find the same kind of objectives: play with not so many rules, have fun, and improvise. Maybe we are not so far from each other after all. The fact is, the period from 2000 to 2010 seems very creative, whereas I am not so sure that the following decade was (the one that is terminating now). I have to investigate. In some dimensions, I understand old school fanatics to be sad that things changed. But on the other hand, we still have many choices in the offer, so much actually that searching for the product that corresponds to you can be quite long. But I think we should not complain. It is just a new era of RPG with several generations playing the same kind of games and so expecting different things from it. For sure, everyone is not playing a single \"universal\" game, but, without being a specialist, when I see all the supplements produced by Paizo on PathFinder, I wonder if most players are not still concentrated on heroic-fantasy games around the D&D rules (being 3rd edition or another).

While reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grognardia , the huge attraction for \"wilderness\", which seems at the root of D&D, is a bit foreign to me. Maybe, the reason is cultural. In France, we have a long lasting past and everyone at school studies the Middle-Age, and the Greeks and Romans before that. In a certain way, a \"dungeon\" is just the biggest tower in a castle, where the lord used to live. Chivalry, in the French unconscious, is quite different than the picture that is depicted in D&D: knights have a law code and serve the widow and the orphan. They are often in love with a lady in a romantic way. They may face magic but not in the D&D sense. In a way, the Arthurian legend remains our reference. For a European eye, D&D looks like a western in tunnels with monsters as enemies, instead of Indians. I know, this is a bit provocative, but D&D is not at all a vision of chivalry, as we have traditionally in France. On the contrary: killing monsters, conquer territories and gain treasures to gain levels look, to me, as a caricature of the American dream. | D&D element | Element of American culture | French traditional chivalry element | Element of French culture | | ----- | ----- | | Travel in the wilderness to conquer territories | This really seems as the ideal of the Far West, which is typical American culture | In French, chivalry, knight quests are for God or for a loved one. | Conquering territories is no more considered as a positive thing (colonization is seen as a bad thing) | | Fight enemies and kill monsters | The violence is part of American culture, as the fighting | The notion of \"monster\" is present in the European legends but in small doses, probably due to Catholicism | Violence is more psychological and verbal than real in French society (maybe because it is forbidden to have weapons) | | Gain treasure | Typical American culture about earthly wealth, which is also typical from protestant countries | The knights were fighting for an ideal and not for money, especially money coming from the murder and robbery of other living beings | Catholic tradition that sees money as something dirty | | Gain experience and progress in the levels | This can be seen as a real appetite for social ascension, and social competition | This appetite also exists but not really in the chivalry tradition | Social progression was also a feature of the Baby Boomers, being in the US or in Europe | In other words, D&D is a very American game: A universe where violence and murder enables to progress in the society and become more powerful... Maybe that deserves more details than this quick simplistic psycho-analysis, but that may also explain why, for many French people, D&D is not very exciting. In France, we have this expression \"Gros Bill\" (\"Big Bill\") who is supposed to represent the super-hero knight, able to massacre everyone. If I saw many Gros-Bills, I never saw them craving for wilderness. Because we are old countries, most of us don't dream about conquest of the wild countries. For sure, D&D can be played like CoC, with more atmosphere and monsters that are so powerful that your should run instead of fighting. But, discovering progressively the roots of D&D, I think I progress in my understanding of why D&D is not my cup of tea.

But knowing that many role players play with tables, I am quite surprised of the \"paper orientation\" of the RPG world. It's obvious that the objective is not to create a graphical RPG, but it could be interesting, for instance, to have random tables managed digitally. Maybe my reflection is driven by some random game helps or by games like Mythic. But in some cases, being able to generate characters dynamically could be really interesting. Indeed, I am quite interested by the mix between random elements and driven elements. If we consider the old school gaming scenarios, the structure is quite often simple: A scenario introduction, with the plot (when there is a plot :), A location description, NPC (quite often monsters) and treasures description. In the case of the use of a GM emulator, easy software tools could be very interesting, something like a web page enabling to manage more complex randomness in a certain context . Interesting topic.
