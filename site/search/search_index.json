Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p> <p>This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p> <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#1-applicability-and-definitions","title":"1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS","text":"<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.</p> <p>A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</p> <p>A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p> <p>The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</p> <p>The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p> <p>A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".</p> <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p> <p>The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p> <p>The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.</p> <p>A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.</p> <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#2-verbatim-copying","title":"2.

COPYING IN QUANTITY","text":"<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p> <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p> <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</p> <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#4-modifications","title":"4. MODIFICATIONS","text":"<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p> <p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</p> <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p> <p>You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p> <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.

In France, we have a long lasting past and everyone at school studies the Middle-Age, and the Greeks and Romans before that. In a certain way, a \"dungeon\" is just the biggest tower in a castle, where the lord used to live.</p> <p>Chivalry, in the French unconscious, is quite different than the picture that is depicted in D&amp;D: knights have a law code and serve the widow and the orphan. They are often in love with a lady in a romantic way. They may face magic but not in the D&amp;D sense. In a way, the Arthurian legend remains our reference.</p> <p>For a European eye, D&amp;D looks like a western in tunnels with monsters as enemies, instead of Indians. I know, this is a bit provocative, but D&amp;D is not at all a vision of chivalry, as we have traditionally in France. On the contrary: killing monsters, conquer territories and gain treasures to gain levels look, to me, as a caricature of the American dream.</p> D&amp;D element Element of American culture French traditional chivalry element Element of French culture Travel in the wilderness to conquer territories This really seems as the ideal of the Far West, which is typical American culture In French, chivalry, knight quests are for God or for a loved one. Conquering  territories is no more considered as a positive thing (colonization is seen as a bad thing) Fight enemies and kill monsters The violence is part of American culture, as the fighting The notion of \"monster\" is present in the European legends but in small doses, probably due to Catholicism Violence is more psychological and verbal than real in French society (maybe because it is forbidden to have weapons) Gain treasure Typical American culture about earthly wealth, which is also typical from protestant countries The knights were fighting for an ideal and not for money, especially money coming from the murder and robbery of other living beings Catholic tradition that sees money as something dirty Gain experience and progress in the levels This can be seen as a real appetite for social ascension, and social competition This appetite also exists but not really in the chivalry tradition Social progression was also a feature of the Baby Boomers, being in the US or in Europe <p>In other words, D&amp;D is a very American game: A universe where violence and murder enables to progress in the society and become more powerful...</p> <p>Maybe that deserves more details than this quick simplistic psycho-analysis, but that may also explain why, for many French people, D&amp;D is not very exciting.</p> <p>In France, we have this expression \"Gros Bill\" (\"Big Bill\") who is supposed to represent the super-hero knight, able to massacre everyone. If I saw many Gros-Bills, I never saw them craving for wilderness. Because we are old countries, most of us don't dream about conquest of the wild countries.</p> <p>For sure, D&amp;D can be played like CoC, with more atmosphere and monsters that are so powerful that your should run instead of fighting.</p> <p>But, discovering progressively the roots of D&amp;D, I think I progress in my understanding of why D&amp;D is not my cup of tea.</p> <p>September 15 2020</p> <p></p>","tags":["Basic Fantasy RPG","Bitume","Call of Cthulhu","Cthulhu Dark","D&D","D20 System","D6 System","Empires & Dynasties","Github","Grogniardia","Jung","Kult","L\u00e9gendes","Mahler","Mal\u00e9fices","Mega","Mkdocs","Mythic","OSRIC","Paranoia","Risus","Simulacres","SRD","Vampire"]},{"location":"blog/2020/#software-help-for-rpgs","title":"Software help for RPGs?","text":"<p>For sure, dice are crucial to RPGs.

The game system could have been innovative, but instead it is complicated and even a bit pretentious. I really dislike this feature in French personality: bragging as if French people had invented the hot water (French expression). Nevertheless, I love France and the French.

There is so much competition, that people try their best to do the best product. I see also a certain kind of \"focus\" in some American games.

When you are young, you are keen to work hard in very large rule books. When you are older, you can run on the accumulated capacities of GM-ing that you have accumulated for so many years.</p> <p>The problem of older players is, for sure, the availability of other players. When everyone has its life, it's not so easy to meet. So, quite often, the sessions are scarcer, and with less players (unless you enroll your own children). For that, simple game engines can be a good way to address the rule part preparation.

For sure, I discovered that a multitude of RPGs and RPG engines were created in 25 years, and some of them seem to me as particularly notable.</p> <p>One of them is Mythic GM Emulator. This engine defined a new way to envisage to RPG by playing adventures with a level of randomness and possibly with no GM. I will write more about that game soon.

There is also the dominant position of DriveThruRPG as a global dealer of RPGs.</p> <p>I can see many great evolutions in the RPG universe in those last years :</p> <ul> <li>The development of Internet enabled many independant authors to create very interesting material, very often for a limited price.</li> <li>The development of print on demand enabled also to differentiate the selling of PDFs from the selling of printed manuals, which is great, considering the disappearance of many gaming shops (at least in France).</li> <li>The SRD 3.5 opened the door to re-interpretations of old school ways of playing RPGs, which can be a good thing. Games should offer many variations and attract several kinds of players.</li> </ul> <p>On this topic, I started reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grogniardia. It is very intesting and enables me to catch on with the RPG world. There are some good moments, in this blog, about the old school RPG gaming, mostly based on the the 2 first editions of D&amp;D (OD&amp;D and Holmes mainly). Even if I was never a player of D&amp;D, the old school is talking to me. The age, maybe. The passion for CoC also where I find the same kind of objectives: play with not so many rules, have fun, and improvise. Maybe we are not so far from each other after all.</p> <p>The fact is, the period from 2000 to 2010 seems very creative, whereas I am not so sure that the following decade was (the one that is terminating now). I have to investigate.</p> <p>In some dimensions, I understand old school fanatics to be sad that things changed. But on the other hand, we still have many choices in the offer, so much actually that searching for the product that corresponds to you can be quite long. But I think we should not complain. It is just a new era of RPG with several generations playing the same kind of games and so expecting different things from it.</p> <p>For sure, everyone is not playing a single \"universal\" game, but, without being a specialist, when I see all the supplements produced by Paizo on PathFinder, I wonder if most players are not still concentrated on heroic-fantasy games around the D&amp;D rules (being 3rd edition or another).</p> <p>September 7 2020</p> <p></p>","tags":["Basic Fantasy RPG","Bitume","Call of Cthulhu","Cthulhu Dark","D&D","D20 System","D6 System","Empires & Dynasties","Github","Grogniardia","Jung","Kult","L\u00e9gendes","Mahler","Mal\u00e9fices","Mega","Mkdocs","Mythic","OSRIC","Paranoia","Risus","Simulacres","SRD","Vampire"]},{"location":"blog/2020/#dodge-and-parrying","title":"Dodge and parrying","text":"<p>This blog is also a pretext to speak about RPG, so that's what I'm going to do.

In a round (let's says 10 seconds), I would have expected every PC to have at least 1 attack and 1 defense. For sure, the order in the combat sequence is depending upon initiative, which means that if you don't have the initiative, you can try to parry (with your shield or your weapon - BTW, weapon parrying power depends on the weapon because a stick is not a sword) or to dodge.</p> <p>Dodging should be the result of DEX and so have some bonus/malus coming from DEX and some bonus/malus coming from AC (it is more complex to dodge with a plate armor than without).</p> <p>Concerning parrying, it could be done at the same level that the attack, or to be some kind of contest versus the attack of the attacker. However, you should choose to parry with your shield or your weapon.</p> <p>For sure, I think the AC concept theoretically takes into account this fact, but I think it breaks the balance in combat. Let us suppose you are a Monk at level 12: You should be unreachable my most creatures, even if you don't attack and you just dodge.</p> <p>The fact of having 2 attacks per round would give you the same number of defenses.

Aucune dimension heroic-fantasy...</p> <p>Normal, le sieur Tolkien \u00e9tait un \u00e9rudit. Et les \u00e9rudits sont la plupart du temps des pompeurs car ils sont trop peu inventifs pour \u00e9crire quelque chose d'original (je parlerai un de ces quatre de Ecco).

Les personnages sont vraiment nases et creux. Ils ne v\u00e9hiculent rien, aucun amour, aucun id\u00e9al, \u00e0 part buter Sauron. Leur confr\u00e9rie en carton p\u00e2te ne fait rien ressentir. Le SdA est un bouquin froid comme une table de dissection, celle de l'\u00e9rudit.</p> <p>Regardez les op\u00e9ras de Wagner (avec les sous-titres) et vous verrez ce que c'est qu'une l\u00e9gende heroic-fantasy avec des sentiments !</p> <p>Enfin, tout \u00e7a pour dire que cet article m'a remis en m\u00e9moire le combat path\u00e9tique de Gandalf et de Saroumane dans le film.

Ensuite, il fallait passer des semaines \u00e0 lire et dig\u00e9rer tout ce mat\u00e9riel.</p> <p>Avec le recul, je me dis que pas mal de MJs devaient adapter un peu les r\u00e8gles \u00e0 leur sauce, car ne serait-ce que l'anglais de certains d'entre eux \u00e9tait quand m\u00eame approximatif.</p> <p>Pour les gens qui seraient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, j'ai r\u00e9uni dans un repo git quelques articles dudit Gary \u00e9crits dans des vieux Dragon. C'est ici : github.com/orey/DandD</p> <p>Comme je n'ai jamais beaucoup jou\u00e9 \u00e0 D&amp;D, je n'avais quasiment rien en stock, \u00e0 part la bo\u00eete de base de D&amp;D en fran\u00e7ais de 1982 de Moldvay, que j'ai donn\u00e9e \u00e0 mon fr\u00e8re je crois.</p> <p></p> <p>Donc, il y a deux ans, je n'avais rien. En me remettant un peu dans le coup, j'ai d\u00e9couvert la vague OSR et la fameuse version D&amp;D 3e et 3.5e. En cherchant un peu, j'ai trouv\u00e9 les 3 bouquins d'occase. Le jeu est quand m\u00eame bien touffu.</p> <p>Puis j'ai repris les investigations sur D&amp;D : d'abord sur D&amp;D 0e, puis sur AD&amp;D 1e o\u00f9 j'ai profit\u00e9 d'une promotion sur DmsGuild pour acheter les 3 bouquins en reprint. En plus de l'\u00e9dition 3.5, j'ai lu l'\u00e9dition gratuite de D&amp;D 5e Basic Rules que j'ai fait imprimer chez Lulu (premi\u00e8re tentative, pas top au niveau rendu).</p> <p>Voil\u00e0. Pour l'instant, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition d'AD&amp;D reste ma favorite, m\u00eame si le Manuel du Ma\u00eetre est quand m\u00eame un peu en mode bazar. J'avoue que j'aime bien la logique didactique de Gary Gygax, ainsi que certains parti-pris qu'il avait sur le JDR.</p> <p>Pour la 4e, c'est vraiment une tentative.

Les r\u00e9sultats sont l\u00e0 :</p> <p></p> <p>On voit bien sur ces deux tableaux l'ampleur des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. D\u00e8s que les deux combattants ont un d6 d'\u00e9cart, les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s chutent.</p> <p>Dans Risus, ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne peut \u00eatre compens\u00e9 par la Gonflette, mais cette derni\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteuse car, si elle permet de booster sur un round (il faut l'envisager dans un combat o\u00f9 l'on se sert de plusieurs Clich\u00e9s), le co\u00fbt ensuite de -1d6 est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s violent.</p> <p>Dans Ghostbusters, c'est plus malin, je trouve : on prend un bon point qui devient un d6 suppl\u00e9mentaire, histoire d'\u00eatre plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Et comme les PJs ont normalement plein de bons points, on peut en consommer quelques uns durant un combat.</p> <p>De m\u00e9moire, dans Star Wars, il y a aussi un moyen de \"booster\" pour compenser provisoirement le d\u00e9calage sur une action.

De plus, les diverses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de mod\u00e9lisation de ces mondes renvoient les uns aux autres : les sorts renvoient aux monstres qui renvoient aux objets magiques. Toutes ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences permettent de mod\u00e9liser plusieurs univers mais on distingue, malgr\u00e9 une mise en page un peu compliqu\u00e9e, un vrai souci de coh\u00e9rence parmi ces \"sous-groupes\".</p> <p>Par exemple, \u00e0 l'usage, il para\u00eet difficile de joueur \u00e0 OD&amp;D sans prendre quelques options de Greyhawk. En effet, le mod\u00e8le basique d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 dans les livrets bruns originaux de OD&amp;D s'appuie sur Chaimail, le wargame que Gygax avait fait avant D&amp;D. Ce n'est que dans Greyhawk que le syst\u00e8me de combat (avec sensibilit\u00e9 aux armes) se d\u00e9veloppe vraiment. J'ai d'ailleurs traduit les tables principales dans la traduction des pouvoirs psioniques (voir ci-dessous).</p> <p>Ce qui est amusant, c'est de d\u00e9couvrir que certains traits de OD&amp;D sont pr\u00e9sents dans les monstres ou les objets magiques de D&amp;D 5e...

M\u00e9caniques de base</p> <p>Il faut garder le d20, les jets \u00e9lev\u00e9s indiquant un bon r\u00e9sultat, les classes, les niveaux, et les races fantastiques. Il faut que le jeu reste unifi\u00e9 et solide dans ses m\u00e9caniques, et il faut suivre cette voie dans tous ses aspects.</p> <p>5. Des tactiques tridimensionnelles</p> <p>Nous voulons continuer d'utiliser des figurines localis\u00e9es dans des carr\u00e9s de 1.5 m\u00e8tre (\"5-foot squares\"). Nous voulons concevoir des mini-jeux (escarmouche) pour fonctionner avec le JDR. Nous en reparlerons prochainement.</p> <p>6. Des options et non pas des restrictions</p> <p>Nous voulons maintenir cette philosophie dans la nouvelle \u00e9dition, m\u00eame si nous entrevoyons des endroits dans le jeu o\u00f9 nous voudrions mettre en place quelques restrictions pour l'\u00e9quilibre du jeu.</p> <p>7. Am\u00e9liorer le jeu</p> <p>Pour bien pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle \u00e9dition au public, nous devons cr\u00e9er un meilleur jeu, plus rapide et plus robuste. Les am\u00e9liorations devraient inclure quelque chose de cool \u00e0 chaque niveau, plus de place \u00e0 la conception pour les options des personnages (mais attention \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9), un meilleur m\u00e9lange de m\u00e9caniques (\"crunch\") et d'histoire ou d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de roleplay (\"fluff\").

Dans la mesure o\u00f9 chaque classe peut tirer de sa propre source de pouvoir ses pouvoirs, le syst\u00e8me remplit sa promesse de pouvoir \u00eatre extensible \u00e0 l'infini : les sources de pouvoirs \"g\u00e9n\u00e8rent\" des diff\u00e9rentes classes (et il sera donc possible d'en cr\u00e9er de nouvelles dans le futur).</p> <p>Il reste toujours possible de sp\u00e9cialiser \"en profondeur\" les classes, mais \"verticalement, sans impacter les autres classes, car n'ayant pas la m\u00eame source de pouvoirs, elles ne sont pas \"en collision\" ou en risque d'incoh\u00e9rence.</p> <p>Bien s\u00fbr, cela implique que le guerrier a une structure de pouvoirs qui est la m\u00eame que celle des magiciens et aux clercs, m\u00eame si son pouvoir est \"martial\", alors que les autres sont respectivement \"arcanes\" ou \"divins\". Ainsi, une source de pouvoirs \"psionic\" est envisageable \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des autres (cf. Player's Guide volume 2). A chacun sa source de pouvoirs !</p> <p>Ce choix de conception a de multiples avantages :</p> <ul> <li>Chaque niveau de personnage peut \u00eatre \"tun\u00e9\" aux petits oignons, et donc \u00eatre \"cool \u00e0 passer (besoin num\u00e9ro 7 de Slavicsek).</li> <li>Comme l'\u00e9chelle de tous les pouvoirs est absolue (en gros chaque pouvoir est d\u00e9crit de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on sur une \u00e9chelle universelle), les diff\u00e9rentes classes de personnages sont comparables en puissance !</li> <li>D'o\u00f9 il s'en suit que le jeu peut \u00eatre \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 parce qu'au final, tout en \u00e9tant dans des \"espaces de pouvoirs\" diff\u00e9rents, les diff\u00e9rentes classes peuvent se comparer les unes aux autres et peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es les unes sur les autres.</li> </ul> <p>Je voudrais r\u00e9sumer ces choix de conception par le diagramme suivant :</p> <p></p> <p>Le mod\u00e8le est bi-dimensionnel :</p> <ul> <li>Chaque source de pouvoir (par exemple A) peut abriter plusieurs classes qui ne sont pas toutes d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es (par exemple A2) ;</li> <li>Il est possible d'ajouter des sources de pouvoirs pour cr\u00e9er de nouvelles classes ;</li> <li>Dans le futur, il ne sera pas plus difficile qu'aujourd'hui de cr\u00e9er de nouvelles classes au travers de nouvelles sources de pouvoirs (par exemple D).</li> </ul> <p>On peut dire que la conception du mod\u00e8le est plut\u00f4t bien faite, surtout si l'on envisage un monde avec diff\u00e9rents formes de magie. D'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, le syst\u00e8me de classes et de niveaux est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9, et de l'autre, il est extensible \"horizontalement\" (on dirait vraiment qu'on parle de software parfois).</p>","tags":["AbeBooks","Akileos","Amazon","Architeuthis","Ars Magica","Aventures Fantastiques","Basic Fantasy RPG","Basic Roleplaying System","Bitume","Blood Bowl","Bloodlust","Call of Cthulhu","Casus Belli","Chainmail","D&D","D6 System","D20 System","DCC","Empire Galactique","Dragon Radieux","Empires & Dynasties","Emysfer","Ep\u00e9es & Sorcellerie","Fate","GURPS","Gygax","Hurlements","Laelith","La Forge De Papier","L\u00e9gendes","Le Bon Coin","Le Donjon Du Dragon","Les Terres de Matnak","Lulu","Magnas Veritas","Mal\u00e9fices","Mega","NeoMega","OSRIC","PBTA","Rakuten","R\u00eave de Dragon","Rolemaster","Runequest","Savage Worlds","Simulacres","Space Opera","Stormbringer","Star Wars","Swords & Wizardry","Troika","Tunnels & Trolls","Warhammer"]},{"location":"blog/2023/#dd-4e-copie-sur-les-jeux-videos","title":"D&amp;D 4e, copi\u00e9 sur les jeux vid\u00e9os ?","text":"<p>Il est possible que le syst\u00e8me soit copi\u00e9 sur les jeux massivement multijoueurs mais ce n'est pas \u00e9vident au premier abord.

H\u00e9 oui, car il faut maintenant choisir le Focus qui lui aussi apporte son lot d'Abilities. Et donc tout est \u00e0 recommencer.</p> <p>Et je n'aime pas les descriptors impos\u00e9s.

Non.</p> <p>This means that the GM uses experience points as a narrative tool. Whenever it seems appropriate, he can introduce complications into the game that affect a specific player, but when he does so, he gives that player 1 XP.</p> <p>C'est grotesque.</p> <p>Et d'abord, comment le MJ sait qu'il est intrusif et non qu'il joue le sc\u00e9nario pr\u00e9vu ? Il se peut qu'une complication soit pr\u00e9vue dans la sc\u00e8ne, c'est m\u00eame g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le cas. Alors les joueurs vont pleurer pour avoir des points d'exp\u00e9rience parce que le MJ apporte des complications ? C'est d\u00e9bile.</p> <p>Cerise sur le g\u00e2teau, le joueur peut refuser l'intrusion en perdant un point d'exp\u00e9rience.

The GM could decide that the two chirogs are DEFINITELY there and the players have no say about it. The GM could decide that the two chirogs MIGHT be there and use a GM intrusion to negotiate their arrival with the players. A purely traditional RPG only offers the first two options (and those options still exist in Numenera); but the intrusion mechanic offers the third. sans doute pas perdre leurs points. Et donc quoi ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?</p> <p>Parce que si le jeu \u00e9tait narrativiste, ce serait le joueur qui raconterait comment se d\u00e9roulent les \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Mais l\u00e0, non, il ne fait que choisir, en mode meta-gaming, une option ou une autre.</p> <p>M\u00eame les exemples de Monte sont foireux :</p> <p>GM intrusion is a way to facilitate what goes on in the world outside the characters. Can the minotaur track the PCs\u2019 movements through the maze? Will the fraying rope hold?</p> <p>Pour moi, nous sommes dans du GMing de base.</p> <p>Say the PCs find a hidden console with some buttons. They learn the right order in which to press the buttons, and a section of the floor disappears. As the GM, you don\u2019t ask the players specifically where their characters are standing. Instead, you give a player 1 XP and say, \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re standing directly over this new hole in the floor.\u201d If he wanted, the player could refuse the XP, spend one of his own, and say, \u201cI leap aside to safety.\u201d Most likely, though, he\u2019ll make the defense roll that you call for and let it play out.</p> <p>Donc quoi, pour chaque sc\u00e8ne o\u00f9 il y des complications, pour que les joueurs daignent les accepter, on leur donne des cookies ?</p> <p>There are two ways for the GM to handle this kind of intrusion. You could say, \u201cYou\u2019re standing in the wrong place, so make a roll.\u201d (It\u2019s a Speed defense roll, of course.) Alternatively, you could say, \u201cYou\u2019re standing in the wrong place. The floor opens under your feet, and you fall down into the darkness.\u201d In the first example, the PC has a chance to save himself. In the second example, he doesn\u2019t. Both are viable options. The distinction is based on any number of factors, including the situation, the characters involved, and the needs of the story. This might seem arbitrary or even capricious, but you\u2019re the master of what the intrusion can and can\u2019t do. RPG mechanics need consistency so players can make intelligent decisions based on how they understand the world to work. But they\u2019ll never base their decisions on GM intrusions. They don\u2019t know when intrusions will happen or what form they will take. GM intrusions are the unpredictable and strange twists of fate that affect a person\u2019s life every day.</p> <p>Je ne comprends rien \u00e0 ce long blabla g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et surtout, je ne vois pas ce que \u00e7a apporte (\u00e0 part filer des r\u00e9compenses aux joueurs pour qu'ils acceptent les probl\u00e8mes).</p> <p>Le fait est qu'il y a d'autres moyens que le m\u00e9ta-gaming pour avoir des surprises dans l'intrigue.</p> <p>When player modifications (such as skill, Effort, and so on) determine that success is automatic, the GM can use GM intrusion to negate the automatic success. The player must roll for the action at its original difficulty level or target number 20, whichever is lower.</p> <p>Oui, mais on peut aussi le faire avec un malus circonstanciel qui justifie que l'action ne soit pas automatique. Comme c'est le MJ qui d\u00e9cide du malus, qu'est-ce que \u00e7a change ?</p> <p>Quelle usine \u00e0 gaz pour rien ! Sans compter que cela rajoute un aspect grippe-sous chez les joueurs qui doivent attendre avec avidit\u00e9 toutes les interventions n\u00e9gatives du MJ en disant que c'est une intrusion.</p> <p>J'ai lu l'article sur The Alexandrian sur les GM intrusions, mais je ne suis pas convaincu.</p> <p>La plupart des jeux proposent des m\u00e9caniques de complications suite \u00e0 des \u00e9checs critiques. Si vous jouez \u00e0 AD&amp;D 1e, vous savez que Gygax avait de nombreuses tables al\u00e9atoires \u00e0 tiroirs pour apporter un peu de surprise dans les sc\u00e9narios, que ce soit aux joueurs ou au MD.</p> <p>Voici un exemple pris sur The Alexandrian :</p> <p>An example frequently used in the Numenera rulebook is the appearance of unexpected reinforcements: The GM uses an intrusion and two more chirogs drop out of the leafy canopy above you!</p> <p>Let\u2019s break down the options here:</p> <p>-The GM could decide NOT to have any reinforcements up.</p> <p>-The GM could decide that the two chirogs are DEFINITELY there and the players have no say about it.</p> <p>-The GM could decide that the two chirogs MIGHT be there and use a GM intrusion to negotiate their arrival with the players.</p> <p>A purely traditional RPG only offers the first two options (and those options still exist in Numenera); but the intrusion mechanic offers the third.</p> <p>Mais pas du tout. Dans beaucoup de sc\u00e9narios, le MJ a une table des rencontres ou il a un certain pourcentage de chances que les choses se passent. S'il juge m\u00eame \u00e0 la vol\u00e9e, en fonction de la tension autour de la table, il n'interrompt pas le jeu pour laisser voir la m\u00e9canique et casser l'ambiance.</p> <p>Peut-\u00eatre ai-je trop jou\u00e9 \u00e0 CoC mais je ne me vois pas du tout faire \u00e7a quand l'ambiance est install\u00e9e. De plus, je trouve cela tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9tentieux de la part du MJ, car les joueurs, normalement, dans le monde du JDR, font ce qu'ils veulent. Ils ont donc de multiples occasions de cr\u00e9er de la surprise et de solliciter la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 du MJ (sauf dans un donjon super cadr\u00e9 bien s\u00fbr).</p> <p>Un autre exemple pris par The Alexandrian est d'utiliser cette m\u00e9canique pour compenser les d\u00e9faillances des r\u00e8gles. L\u00e0, les bras m'en tombent. Comme si le MJ ne pouvait pas g\u00e9rer \u00e7a sans meta-gaming.</p> <p>Une chose est certaine : le m\u00e9ta-gaming n'est vraiment pas mon truc. Tout comme les jeux type PbtA.

Quand je vois les vieux jeux, les Grands Anciens comme dirait HPL, je suis impressionn\u00e9 par la qualit\u00e9 :</p> <ul> <li>Warhammer v4 est un tr\u00e8s bon jeu tr\u00e8s facile d'acc\u00e8s et toujours aussi exp\u00e9ditif dans les combats (notamment avec la m\u00e9canique d'avantage).</li> <li>D&amp;D 5e est un tr\u00e8s bon compromis entre du vieux et du nouveau, il est moins tactique que la 4e mais reste assez proche de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition d'AD&amp;D.</li> <li>Call of Cthulhu 7e, c'est toujours du CoC malgr\u00e9 le fait que les caract\u00e9ristiques soient devenues des pourcentages (mais pourquoi ?)</li> <li>J'ai acquis en occase Runequest 4e en anglais et l\u00e0 encore, on est dans le super classique.</li> </ul> <p>Quand on a v\u00e9cu les premi\u00e8res \u00e9ditions de tout cela, et les remakes plus ou moins foireux, on est content de ce qui sort aujourd'hui (m\u00eame si \u00e7a co\u00fbte toujours beaucoup de sous).</p> <p>A la r\u00e9flexion, c'est sans doute un truc de vieux. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait plein d'innovations dans les jeux originaux (par exemple Warhammer 3e ou D&amp;D 4e), les \u00e9diteurs reviennent aux bonnes vieilles recettes en les remettant l\u00e9g\u00e8rement au go\u00fbt du jour. C'est pour moi ce qu'a tent\u00e9 de faire Cubicle7 avec la derni\u00e8re \u00e9dition de Warhammer.</p> <p>Enfin, les fans de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition ne seront pas d\u00e9\u00e7u : c'est pareil en mieux.</p> <p>En bonus, le PDF gratuit de conversion de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition \u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me.</p> 28 mars 2024","tags":["Adventures in Middle-Earth","Basic Roleplaying System","Black Flag","Call of Cthulhu","Cepheus","Chaosium","Cubicle7","Cypher","D&D","Empire Galactique","FU","Fudge","Games Workshop","GURPS","Kobold Press","Lord of the Rings","Mega","Mongoose","Risus","Runequest","Space Opera","Tales of the Valiant","Traveller","Warhammer","Wizards of the Coast"]},{"location":"blog/2024/#du-srd-de-logl-et-de-lorc","title":"Du SRD, de l'OGL et de l'ORC !","text":"<p>Hello et bienvenue aux \u00e9gar\u00e9s qui regardent parfois cette page !</p> <p>A l'or\u00e9e de ce printemps 2024, je me r\u00e9sous \u00e0 faire une petite bafouille pour... des bookmarks !</p>","tags":["Adventures in Middle-Earth","Basic Roleplaying System","Black Flag","Call of Cthulhu","Cepheus","Chaosium","Cubicle7","Cypher","D&D","Empire Galactique","FU","Fudge","Games Workshop","GURPS","Kobold Press","Lord of the Rings","Mega","Mongoose","Risus","Runequest","Space Opera","Tales of the Valiant","Traveller","Warhammer","Wizards of the Coast"]},{"location":"blog/2024/#le-plus-recent-dd-srd-avec-bookmarks-en-francais-en-anglais","title":"Le plus r\u00e9cent : D&amp;D SRD avec bookmarks en fran\u00e7ais en anglais","text":"<p>Bon, certes WotC a publi\u00e9 des documents SRDs en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais, mais les bookmarks ne sont soit pas l\u00e0, soit en vrac.

D&amp;D 5e a un peu vari\u00e9 cette unicit\u00e9 de caract\u00e9ristique entre les diff\u00e9rentes classes de personnages (par exemple le Barde utilisant le Charisma pour la magie) mais sinon, cette affectation des pouvoirs \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques est int\u00e9ressante car elle peut m\u00eame permettre de n'avoir que des personnages \"psychistes\" mais dont les points forts sont sur diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques.</p> <p></p> <p>Le syst\u00e8me d'Alternity est assez int\u00e9ressant. Bien s\u00fbr, le psychiste poss\u00e8de des points d'\u00e9nergie psionique \u00e9gaux \u00e0 sa Will, ce qui rappelle le syst\u00e8me de magie de BRP avec les points de magie \u00e9gaux au Power. Petite innovation, ce nombre de points peut \u00eatre multipli\u00e9 par un facteur 0.5 si le personnage n'est pas uniquement un psychiste et 1.5 s'il est un Fraal.</p> <p>Mais c'est dans le syst\u00e8me de combat que se situe la partie int\u00e9ressante. Certes, si un psychiste utilise la t\u00e9l\u00e9kin\u00e9sie pour se battre ou un autre pouvoir psychique, nous revenons \u00e0 du classique avec un combat \u00e0 mains nues, en m\u00eal\u00e9e ou \u00e0 distance. Mais quand le combat se d\u00e9roule sur le plan psychique, Alternity distingue trois cas :</p> <ul> <li>Les assauts,</li> <li>Les subversions,</li> <li>les pi\u00e8ges.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Le syst\u00e8me en lui-m\u00eame n'est pas g\u00e9nial. Les assauts font l'objet d'un jet de comp\u00e9tence psy avec comme modificateurs en gros la r\u00e9sistance du personnage attaqu\u00e9 (modificateur de Will). Ce dernier peut potentiellement \"parer\" mentalement s'il poss\u00e8de Mind Shield. Si le coup est gagnant, le d\u00e9fenseur peut r\u00e9duire les points perdus en utilisant Psychic Armor. Mouais.</p> <p>Le probl\u00e8me de ce syst\u00e8me est qu'il n'est pas tr\u00e8s homog\u00e8ne. Dans certaines versions de D&amp;D, le syst\u00e8me assume d'aller un peu plus loin avec une Psychic Armor Class, ce qui fait que tous les personnages peuvent \u00eatre concern\u00e9s. L\u00e0, juste ceux qui ont les caract\u00e9ristiques peuvent se d\u00e9fendre activement.</p> <p>Gygax avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tent\u00e9 de contourner ce probl\u00e8me, m\u00eame si son syst\u00e8me dans D&amp;D 0e n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s lisible. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que le personnage progresse dans l'acquisition de pouvoirs, ils gagne des attaques et des d\u00e9fenses psychiques.</p> <p>Les subversions sont des genres d'assauts destin\u00e9s \u00e0 affaiblir l'opposant. Les pi\u00e8ges sont un concept int\u00e9ressant, sachant que la victime doit cumuler un certain nombre des succ\u00e8s pour s'en sortir. Cela ressemble un peu aux r\u00e8gles de M\u00e9ga 2 pour se sortir d'un transfert.</p> <p>Bref, ce bouquin n'a pas marqu\u00e9 l'histoire mais je retiens deux id\u00e9es int\u00e9ressantes :</p> <ul> <li>Les pouvoirs sont associ\u00e9s \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques,</li> <li>Les combats psychiques peuvent \u00eatre \"typ\u00e9s\".</li> </ul> <p>10 mai 2025</p> <p> </p>","tags":["Alternity","Basic Fantasy RPG","Basic Roleplaying System","Black Hack","Black Sword Hack","Cairn","Castles & Crusades","Chaosium","D6 System","D20 System","D&D","DCC","Index Card","Into the Odd","Knave","Microlite","M\u00f6rk Borg","Old-School Essentials","OSRIC","Searchers of the Unknown","Shadowdark","Swords & Wizardry","The Power","Troika","Whitehack","Wizards of the Coast"]},{"location":"blog/2025/#relativite-du-systeme-d100-du-brp-de-chaosium","title":"Relativit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me d100 du BRP de Chaosium","text":"<p>En compl\u00e9ment de la page sur les moteurs de jeux de r\u00f4le g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, notons que le moteur de jeu d100 BRP de Chaosium est b\u00e2ti sur des hypoth\u00e8ses plus dures pour les PJs que le syst\u00e8me D&amp;D.</p> <p>Voir la page d\u00e9di\u00e9e : r\u00e9flexions sur le syst\u00e8me d100 de BRP</p> <p>Lien vers le SRD de BRP v5 et sa licence ORC.</p> <p>1er mai 2025</p> <p> </p>","tags":["Alternity","Basic Fantasy RPG","Basic Roleplaying System","Black Hack","Black Sword Hack","Cairn","Castles & Crusades","Chaosium","D6 System","D20 System","D&D","DCC","Index Card","Into the Odd","Knave","Microlite","M\u00f6rk Borg","Old-School Essentials","OSRIC","Searchers of the Unknown","Shadowdark","Swords & Wizardry","The Power","Troika","Whitehack","Wizards of the Coast"]},{"location":"blog/2025/#le-srd-52-de-dd","title":"Le SRD 5.2 de D&amp;D","text":"<p>Le voil\u00e0 : SRD5.2 CC.</p> <p>Dans les points importants :</p> <ul> <li>Il y a tout pour jouer \u00e0 D&amp;D et cr\u00e9er ses propres contenus avec ;</li> <li>La mise en page est mieux faite que le SRD 5.1 ;</li> <li>Un gros effort a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sur les Challenge Ratings (j'en parlerai sans doute plus en d\u00e9tails dans le futur) ;</li> <li>La licence OGL est abandonn\u00e9e.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Bon, disons-le tout net, Jeremy Crawford (photo ci-dessus) a pris le pouvoir absolu sur D&amp;D 5e, ce qui explique l'augmentation de la qualit\u00e9 des \"livrables\", que ce soit au niveau du SRD ou au niveau des livres qui sont extr\u00eamement travaill\u00e9s par lui et son \u00e9quipe.

Il est la compression de deux termes : psi dans le sens de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne psychique, et electronics. Psionics devient un terme d\u00e9crivant la discipline qui \u00e9tudie les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques avec les moyens de l\u2019ing\u00e9nierie moderne de l\u2019\u00e9poque, soit l\u2019\u00e9lectronique. Malgr\u00e9 la promotion de personnes comme John W. Campbell, le terme restera utilis\u00e9 uniquement dans le monde de la science-fiction, avant d\u2019\u00eatre int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans le monde des jeux de r\u00f4les.</p> <p>La version originale de Donjons &amp; Dragons, dite OD&amp;D, est publi\u00e9e en 1974 sous la forme de trois livrets \u00e0 la couverture marron. On trouve dans le premier livret, Men &amp; Magic, un certain nombre de sorts ressemblant \u00e0 des pouvoirs psychiques, et dans le deuxi\u00e8me, Monsters &amp; Treasures, les premi\u00e8res r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 des pouvoirs psychiques, dans la section traitant des \u00e9p\u00e9es magiques. A l\u2019\u00e9poque, le terme psionic n\u2019est pas utilis\u00e9.</p> <p>En 1976, dans le troisi\u00e8me suppl\u00e9ment Eldritch Wizardry cosign\u00e9 par Gary Gygax et Brian Blume, publi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s Greyhawk et Blackmoor, les pouvoirs psychiques arrivent dans le monde des personnages-joueurs et des personnages-non-joueurs. Les r\u00e8gles sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re assez chaotique, ce qui g\u00e9n\u00e9rera vite la r\u00e9putation d\u2019un syst\u00e8me injouable dans le monde des joueurs.</p> <p>Derri\u00e8re la juste critique sur la pr\u00e9sentation, beaucoup de joueurs semblent avoir rejet\u00e9 le suppl\u00e9ment en raison du fait m\u00eame de proposer, en extension \u00e0 un jeu m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique, une gestion des pouvoirs mentaux, habituellement pr\u00e9sents dans les univers de science-fiction.</p> <p>Nous proposons ici une double pr\u00e9sentation des r\u00e8gles psioniques du suppl\u00e9ment Eldritch Wizardry, suppl\u00e9ment qui contient d\u2019autres choses non traduites en ces pages (notamment le Druide, des monstres, etc.) :</p> <ul> <li>La premi\u00e8re partie propose une traduction compl\u00e8te, la plus fid\u00e8le possible, des r\u00e8gles originales relatives aux pouvoirs psioniques. En effet, le texte original \u00e9tant touffu, nous avons veill\u00e9 \u00e0 traduire le plus fid\u00e8lement possible ses nuances (ce qui donne un style parfois un peu lourd, proche du style original). Dans cette partie, nous avons tent\u00e9 de respecter l\u2019aspect original des r\u00e8gles (polices, alignements, etc.).</li> <li>Cette premi\u00e8re partie a \u00e9t\u00e9, en quelque sorte, \u00ab augment\u00e9e \u00bb : en effet, Eldritch Wizardry \u00e9tant une extension de OD&amp;D, le texte pointe vers les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pr\u00e9sentes dans les livrets pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ; nous avons extrait ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pour en proposer une traduction au sein m\u00eame de ce livre, de sorte que cette compilation devrait se suffire \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame et ne pas n\u00e9cessiter d\u2019ouvrir les ouvrages pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la s\u00e9rie.</li> <li>La seconde partie propose une r\u00e9organisation compl\u00e8te de ces r\u00e8gles visant \u00e0 les pr\u00e9senter de mani\u00e8re plus claire et plus logique ; nous esp\u00e9rons que nous aurons \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la hauteur du chantier, plus complexe qu\u2019il n\u2019y paraissait au d\u00e9part.</li> </ul> <p>La consultation de certains sites am\u00e9ricains a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour s\u2019assurer de la bonne compr\u00e9hension de certaines r\u00e8gles ambigu\u00ebs qui, encore aujourd\u2019hui, provoquent des commentaires et des incompr\u00e9hensions.</p> <p>Une fois \u00e9clairci, le syst\u00e8me se montre tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, non seulement parce qu\u2019il est tr\u00e8s \u00ab gygaxien \u00bb (on le voit notamment au travers de l\u2019utilisation de r\u00e8gles gigognes), mais aussi parce qu\u2019il est le premier syst\u00e8me complet de pouvoirs psychiques, tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de la magie de OD&amp;D, et qu\u2019il inspirera beaucoup d\u2019autres syst\u00e8mes de pouvoirs bas\u00e9s sur la consommation de points d\u2019\u00e9nergie psionique.</p> <p>Rouboudou</p> <p>Ao\u00fbt 2023</p>","tags":["D&D","Download"]},{"location":"downloads/eldritch-wizardry/#telechargements","title":"T\u00e9l\u00e9chargements","text":"<p>T\u00e9l\u00e9chargez le document.</p> T\u00e9l\u00e9charger v1.1 EldritchWizardry-PouvoirsEtCombatPsionique-FR-v1-1.pdf T\u00e9l\u00e9charger v1.0 EldritchWizardry-PouvoirsEtCombatPsionique-FR-v1-0.pdf <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>","tags":["D&D","Download"]},{"location":"downloads/eldritch-wizardry/#license","title":"License","text":"<p>Ce document est une oeuvre de fan, est gratuit et ne peut \u00eatre vendu et est mis \u00e0 disposition sous la licence OGL.</p>","tags":["D&D","Download"]},{"location":"downloads/eldritch-wizardry/#open-game-license-version-10a","title":"OPEN GAME LICENSE Version 1.0a","text":"<p>The following text is the property of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. and is Copyright 2000 Wizards of the Coast, Inc (\u201dWizards\u201d).

While that might be true, in the next iteration of the game we're experimenting with something we call the bounded accuracy system.</p> <p>The basic premise behind the bounded accuracy system is simple: we make no assumptions on the DM's side of the game that the player's attack and spell accuracy, or their defenses, increase as a result of gaining levels. Instead, we represent the difference in characters of various levels primarily through their hit points, the amount of damage they deal, and the various new abilities they have gained. Characters can fight tougher monsters not because they can finally hit them, but because their damage is sufficient to take a significant chunk out of the monster's hit points; likewise, the character can now stand up to a few hits from that monster without being killed easily, thanks to the character's increased hit points. Furthermore, gaining levels grants the characters new capabilities, which go much farther toward making your character feel different than simple numerical increases.</p> <p>Now, note that I said that we make no assumptions on the DM's side of the game about increased accuracy and defenses. This does not mean that the players do not gain bonuses to accuracy and defenses. It does mean, however, that we do not need to make sure that characters advance on a set schedule, and we can let each class advance at its own appropriate pace. Thus, wizards don't have to gain a +10 bonus to weapon attack rolls just for reaching a higher level in order to keep participating; if wizards never gain an accuracy bonus, they can still contribute just fine to the ongoing play experience.</p> <p>This extends beyond simple attacks and damage. We also make the same assumptions about character ability modifiers and skill bonuses. Thus, our expected DCs do not scale automatically with level, and instead a DC is left to represent the fixed value of the difficulty of some task, not the difficulty of the task relative to level.</p> <p>We think the bounded accuracy system is good for the game for a number of different reasons, including the following:</p> <p>Getting better at something means actually getting better at something. Since target numbers (DCs for checks, AC, and so on) and monster accuracy don't scale with level, gaining a +1 bonus means you are actually 5% better at succeeding at that task, not simply hitting some basic competence level. When a fighter gets a +1 increase to his or her attack bonus, it means he or she hits monsters across the board 5% more often. This means that characters, as they gain levels, see a tangible increase in their competence, not just in being able to accomplish more amazing things, but also in how often they succeed at tasks they perform regularly.</p> <p>Nonspecialized characters can more easily participate in many scenes. While it's true that increases in accuracy are real and tangible, it also means that characters can achieve a basic level of competence just through how players assign their ability bonuses. Although a character who gains a +6 bonus to checks made to hide might do so with incredible ease, the character with only a naked ability bonus still has a chance to participate. We want to use the system to make it so that specialized characters find tasks increasingly trivial, while other characters can still make attempts without feeling they are wasting their time.</p> <p>The DM's monster roster expands, never contracts. Although low-level characters probably don't stack up well against higher-level monsters, thanks to the high hit points and high damage numbers of those monsters, as the characters gain levels, the lower-level monsters continue to be useful to the DM, just in greater numbers. While we might fight only four goblins at a time at 1st level, we might take on twelve of them at 5th level without breaking a sweat. Since the monsters don't lose the ability to hit the player characters\u2014instead they take out a smaller percentage chunk of the characters' hit points\u2014the DM can continue to increase the number of monsters instead of needing to design or find whole new monsters. Thus, the repertoire of monsters available for DMs to use in an adventure only increases over time, as new monsters become acceptable challenges and old monsters simply need to have their quantity increased.</p> <p>Bounded accuracy makes it easier to DM and easier to adjudicate improvised scenes. After a short period of DMing, DMs should gain a clear sense of how to assign DCs to various tasks. If the DM knows that for most characters a DC of 15 is a mildly difficult check, then the DM starts to associate DC values with in-world difficulties. Thus, when it comes time to improvise, a link has been created between the difficulty of the challenge in the world (balancing as you run across this rickety bridge is pretty tough due to the breaking planks, especially if you're not a nimble character) and the target number. Since those target numbers don't change, the longer a DM runs his or her game, the easier it is going to be to set quick target numbers, improvise monster attack bonuses and AC, or determine just what kind of bonus a skilled NPC has to a particular check. The DM's understanding of how difficult tasks are ceases to be a moving target under a bounded accuracy system.</p> <p>It opens up new possibilities of encounter and adventure design. A 1st-level character might not fight the black dragon plaguing the town in a face-to-face fight and expect to survive. But if they rally the town to their side, outfit the guards with bows and arrows, and whittle the dragon down with dozens of attacks instead of only four or five, the possibilities grow. With the bounded accuracy system, lower-level creatures banding together can erode a higher-level creature's hit points, which cuts both ways; now, fights involving hordes of orcs against the higher-level party can be threatening using only the basic orc stat block, and the city militia can still battle against the fire giants rampaging at the gates without having to inflate the statistics of the city guards to make that possible.</p> <p>It is easier for players and DMs to understand the relative strength and difficulty of things. Under the bounded accuracy system, a DM can describe a hobgoblin wearing chainmail, and, no matter what the level of the characters, a player can reasonably guess that the hobgoblin's AC is around 15; the description of the world matches up to mechanical expectations, and eventually players will see chainmail, or leather armor, or plate mail in game and have an instinctive response to how tough things are. Likewise, a DM knows that he or she can reasonably expect players to understand the difficulty of things based purely on their in-world description, and so the DM can focus more on the details of the world rather than on setting player expectations.</p> <p>It's good for verisimilitude. The bounded accuracy system lets us perpetually associate difficulty numbers with certain tasks based on what they are in the world, without the need to constantly escalate the story behind those tasks. For example, we can say that breaking down an iron-banded wooden door is a DC 17 check, and that can live in the game no matter what level the players are. There's no need to constantly escalate the in-world descriptions to match a growing DC; an iron-banded door is just as tough to break down at 20th level as it was at 1st, and it might still be a challenge for a party consisting of heroes without great Strength scores. There's no need to make it a solid adamantine door encrusted with ancient runes just to make it a moderate challenge for the high-level characters. Instead, we let that adamantine door encrusted with ancient runes have its own high DC as a reflection of its difficulty in the world. If players have the means of breaking down the super difficult adamantine door, it's because they pursued player options that make that so, and it is not simply a side effect of continuing to adventure.</p> <p>This feeds in with the earlier point about DMs and players understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of things, since it not only makes it easier to understand play expectations, but it also ties those expectations very firmly to what those things are in the world. Now, we want to avoid situations where DMs feel bound by the numbers. (\"Hey,\" says the player, \"you said it was an iron-bound wooden door and I rolled a 17, what do you mean I didn't break it down?\") We hope to do that by making sure we focus more on teaching DMs how to determine DCs and other numbers, and letting them adjust descriptions and difficulties based on their needs.</p> <p>Rodney Thompson</p> <p>(June 3 2012)</p> <p>Rodney Thompson began freelancing in the RPG industry in 2001 before graduating from the University of Tennessee.

C'est la deuxi\u00e8me partie du contenu du texte dont il question.</p> <p>and is an enhancement over the prior art</p> <p>Cette phase est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9trange et cela sur deux points.</p> <p>Tout d'abord, WotC semble vouloir dire que de nouvelles r\u00e8gles port\u00e9es par la personne exer\u00e7ant la licence doit \u00eatre une am\u00e9lioration de ce qui existe. C'est un v\u0153u pieu, mais tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 prouver.</p> <p>Par exemple, le Black Hack est-il une am\u00e9lioration des r\u00e8gles ou une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration ?</p> <p>Le second point est que cela n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec le fait d'\u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'Open Game Content (OGC). Par rapport \u00e0 la loi, toute r\u00e8gle de jeu est OGC, qu'elle soit une am\u00e9lioration ou pas.</p> <ul> <li>and any additional content clearly identified as Open Game Content by the Contributor,</li> </ul> <p>Il s'agit l\u00e0 de la troisi\u00e8me partie du contenu : un contenu soumis au copyright mais que le titulaire de la licence aurait envie de d\u00e9clarer OGC.</p> <p>Notons que nous entrons ici un peu dans la confusion. Nous parlions jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, WotC, qui d\u00e9finissait une licence pour que des personnes ou des compagnies aient l'usage de son contenu (A dans le sch\u00e9mas ci-dessus). Nous sommes maintenant \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 nous parlons des d\u00e9clarations des possesseurs de licences (B dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus).</p> <p>C'est le probl\u00e8me de vouloir faire une licence g\u00e9n\u00e9rique.</p> <p>Au titre de la loi am\u00e9ricaine, le contenu soumis au copyright reste soumis au copyright. Comme ce contenu a une certaine valeur, son possesseur devrait d\u00e9finir la licence avec ceux qui en auront l'usage. Cette licence doit avoir une dur\u00e9e, des conditions et un arrangement financier. Bien entendu, rien n'oblige le possesseur de ce copyright \u00e0 utiliser la licence OGL pour licencier son contenu.</p> <p>and means any work covered by this License, including translations and derivative works under copyright law, but specifically excludes Product Identity.</p> <p>Cette phrase est tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange.</p> <p>De fait, les \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es selon la loi du copyright ne sont pas OGC (les traductions ne sont pas OGC de l'avis m\u00eame de la licence OGL, voir ci-dessus).</p> <p>Il est possible que WotC ait voulu parler des traductions et des autres \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es soumises au copyright que les auteurs auraient voulu mettre en OGC quand m\u00eame (alors qu'elles ne le sont pas par d\u00e9faut). Mais la formulation est totalement obscure si c'est cette interpr\u00e9tation qu'il faut retenir.</p> <p>Mais voyons donc la fameuse notion de Product Identity.</p> <p>(e) \"Product Identity\" means product and product line names, logos and identifying marks including trade dress;</p> <p>Nous parlons ici de trademarks.</p> <p>artifacts; creatures characters; stories, storylines, plots, thematic elements, dialogue, incidents, language, artwork, symbols, designs, depictions, likenesses, formats, poses, concepts, themes and graphic, photographic and other visual or audio representations; names and descriptions of characters, spells, enchantments,</p> <p>Malheureusement, les sorts sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des r\u00e8gles du jeu. Le cas des sorts associ\u00e9s \u00e0 des noms propres est plus ambigu, car nous sommes entre le Product Identity et l'OGC, donc d\u00e9fendable en tant que Product Identity dans la mesure o\u00f9 la r\u00e8gle est partie int\u00e9grante de l'univers (cf. remarques ci-dessus \u00e0 propos de Dark Sun).</p> <p>personalities, teams, personas, likenesses and special abilities; places, locations, environments, creatures, equipment, magical or supernatural abilities or effects, logos, symbols, or graphic designs;</p> <p>Cette liste est assez \u00e9trange car contraire avec le contenu ouvert par WotC dans le SRD 5.1 de D&amp;D. En ouvrant les sorts dans le SRD 5.1, WotC est en contradiction avec la licence appos\u00e9e sur le SRD !</p> <p>On verra plus loin, avec l'affaire du SRD V2.0, qu'en plus de 20 ans, la compr\u00e9hension du droit du copyright semble toujours obscure chez certaines personnes de WotC.</p> <p>and any other trademark or registered trademark clearly identified as Product identity by the owner of the Product Identity, and which specifically excludes the Open Game Content;</p> <p>Encore les trademarks.</p> <p>(f) \"Trademark\" means the logos, names, mark, sign, motto, designs that are used by a Contributor to identify itself or its products or the associated products contributed to the Open Game License by the Contributor</p> <p>De nouveau les trademarks.</p> <p>(g) \"Use\", \"Used\" or \"Using\" means to use, Distribute, copy, edit, format, modify, translate and otherwise create Derivative Material of Open Game Content.</p> <p>M\u00eame d\u00e9finition que Derivative Work de la loi US.</p> <p>(h) \"You\" or \"Your\" means the licensee in terms of this agreement.</p> <p>\u00a72. The License: This License applies to any Open Game Content that contains a notice indicating that the Open Game Content may only be Used under and in terms of this License. You must affix such a notice to any Open Game Content that you Use. No terms may be added to or subtracted from this License except as described by the License itself. No other terms or conditions may be applied to any Open Game Content distributed using this License.</p> <p>\u00a73. Offer and Acceptance: By Using the Open Game Content You indicate Your acceptance of the terms of this License.</p> <p>\u00a74. Grant and Consideration: In consideration for agreeing to use this License, the Contributors grant You a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license with the exact terms of this License to Use, the Open Game Content.</p> <p>Droit d'usage du contenu OGC.</p> <p>La formulation employ\u00e9e, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, est \u00e9trangement emprunt\u00e9e au cas de l'administration am\u00e9ricaine d\u00e9crit dans le cadre de la loi US sur le copyright.</p> <p>En effet, dans le paragraphe 105 de ladite loi, il est stipul\u00e9 qu'un employ\u00e9 de l'Etat appartenant \u00e0 certaines organisations conserve son copyright mais qu'on peut lui ordonner de donner \u00e0 l'Etat une irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, nonexclusive license to reproduce, distribute, perform, or display.</p> <p>Le probl\u00e8me est que WotC n'est pas l'Etat, que la licence est un contrat entre deux parties et que si une des deux parties meurt ou le souhaite, la licence s'arr\u00eate, ce qui n'est pas le cas de l'Etat am\u00e9ricain.</p> <p>\u00a75.Representation of Authority to Contribute: If You are contributing original material as Open Game Content, You represent that Your Contributions are Your original creation and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p> <p>Encore une formulation absconse : que doit-on entendre par \"mat\u00e9riau original\" (original material) ? Si ce mat\u00e9riau est compos\u00e9 de r\u00e8gles, alors aucun copyright ne peut \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9 ; sinon, ce mat\u00e9riau est sous copyright.</p> <p>Dans le premier cas, il n'y a pas besoin de repr\u00e9sentation ; dans le second, le possesseur du copyright devrait poser une notice copyright comme demand\u00e9 par le droit am\u00e9ricain.</p> <p>De plus, rien n'indique que le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence OGL voudra utiliser la m\u00eame licence quand il voudra licencier son travail d\u00e9riv\u00e9, celui sur lequel il poss\u00e8de le copyright.</p> <p>Notons qu'il est dangereux de pr\u00e9sumer que l'on donne gratuitement un copyright sans licence, car utiliser la licence OGL sur un contenu copyright\u00e9 que l'on poss\u00e8de et que l'on souhaite ouvrir est tr\u00e8s dangereux pour le possesseur - et le droit am\u00e9ricain nous le dit.</p> <p>Supposons que je cr\u00e9e dans le cadre d'une licence OGL D&amp;D Mister DarkFuzz, un h\u00e9ros aux caract\u00e9ristiques sp\u00e9ciales et que je l'int\u00e8gre dans ma d\u00e9claration OCG en tant que copyright que je transforme en OGC. Supposons que quelqu'un produise une campagne \u00e0 succ\u00e8s, des livres et un film sur Mister DarkFuzz. Quels sont mes moyens de contr\u00f4ler mon copyright ?</p> <p>\u00a76.Notice of License Copyright: You must update the COPYRIGHT NOTICE portion of this License to include the exact text of the COPYRIGHT NOTICE of any Open Game Content You are copying, modifying or distributing, and You must add the title, the copyright date, and the copyright holder's name to the COPYRIGHT NOTICE of any original Open Game Content you Distribute.</p> <p>Evidemment, r\u00e9utiliser du contenu non soumis \u00e0 copyright (OGC) ne n\u00e9cessite pas de cr\u00e9diter ni WotC, ni Gygax, ni qui que ce soit. Car, les r\u00e8gles de D&amp;D, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles sont g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, ne peuvent pas porter de copyright.</p> <p>On dirait que cet article est l\u00e0 pour dire \u00e0 Hasbro, la maison m\u00e8re de WotC : regardez, vous avez achet\u00e9 de l'IP (Intellectual Property) ! Mais le fait est que non. Au regard du droit US sur le copyright, tout le SRD \u00e9tait ouvert avant m\u00eame qu'il ne soit publi\u00e9.</p> <p>Il n'est donc pas besoin de cr\u00e9diter quelqu'un pour un mat\u00e9riau qui est dans le domaine public.</p> <p>J'entends des m\u00e2choires qui grincent, mais c'est bien la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.</p> <p>\u00a77. Use of Product Identity: You agree not to Use any Product Identity, including as an indication as to compatibility, except as expressly licensed in another, independent Agreement with the owner of each element of that Product Identity.</p> <p>WotC rejoint le droit am\u00e9ricain (voir les licences explicites dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus). On ne peut pas licencier du contenu sous copyright sans quelques pr\u00e9cautions.</p> <p>You agree not to indicate compatibility or co-adaptability with any Trademark or Registered Trademark in conjunction with a work containing Open Game Content except as expressly licensed in another, independent Agreement with the owner of such Trademark or Registered Trademark.</p> <p>La cons\u00e9quence de cette phrase est de statuer la compatibilit\u00e9 avec D&amp;D par une phrase du genre \"compatible avec le plus grand JDR du monde\".</p> <p>The use of any Product Identity in Open Game Content does not constitute a challenge to the ownership of that Product Identity. The owner of any Product Identity used in Open Game Content shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to that Product Identity.</p> <p>Amusant : cette remarque est totalement conforme avec le droit am\u00e9ricain. Tout possesseur de copyright garde ses droits m\u00eame s'il a permis \u00e0 des tiers d'utiliser un ou plusieurs droits non exclusifs de mani\u00e8re non payante. Ainsi, oui, WotC a raison, accorder l'usage gratuit d'un contenu sous copyright d\u00e9clar\u00e9 comme OGC ne remet pas en cause la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du copyright, et n'est pas un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (cas des licences non-exclusives).</p> <p>\u00a78. Identification: If you distribute Open Game Content You must clearly indicate which portions of the work that you are distributing are Open Game Content.</p> <p>Voil\u00e0 quelque chose de contraignant et j'avoue ne l'avoir jamais vraiment vu faire. Les gens pr\u00e9cisent, au contraire, ce qui est Product Identity. Les reste est OGC.</p> <p>\u00a79. Updating the License: Wizards or its designated Agents may publish updated versions of this License. You may use any authorized version of this License to copy, modify and distribute any Open Game Content originally distributed under any version of this License.</p> <p>Soit en bon fran\u00e7ais :</p> <p>\u00a79. Mise \u00e0 jour de la licence : Wizards ou ses repr\u00e9sentants d\u00e9sign\u00e9s peuvent publier des mises \u00e0 jour de cette licence. Vous pouvez utiliser n'importe quelle version autoris\u00e9e de cette licence pour copier, modifier et distribuer n'importe quel contenu Open Game Content originellement distribu\u00e9 sous n'importe quelle version de cette licence.</p> <p>Cet article indique que WotC peut d\u00e9cider que la version V1.0a est non autoris\u00e9e et autoriser une V2 qui elle demande 50% des revenus faits par le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence. C'est en un sens ce qu'ils ont fait avec la tentative de licence V2.0.</p> <p>Beaucoup de gens ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cet article comme un risque juridique important.</p> <p>Au final, ce n'en est pas un du tout en raison du type de contenus publi\u00e9 par WotC (voir plus bas).</p> <p>\u00a710. Copy of this License: You MUST include a copy of this License with every copy of the Open Game Content You Distribute.</p> <p>Nous remettons en cause ce besoin au regard de la loi sur le copyright (voir plus loin) en raison du type de contenu distribu\u00e9 par WotC \u00e0 l'origine : si le premier contenu n'a pas de copyright, il n'est pas besoin de cascader la licence.</p> <p>\u00a711. Use of Contributor Credits: You may not market or advertise the Open Game Content using the name of any Contributor unless You have written permission from the Contributor to do so.</p> <p>Encore une fois le sujet des trademarks. Oui, personne ne doit user des trademarks de WotC sans accord. Mais c'est vrai de toutes les trademarks.</p> <p>\u00a712. Inability to Comply: If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Open Game Content due to statute, judicial order, or governmental regulation then You may not Use any Open Game Material so affected.</p> <p>\u00a713. Termination: This License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with all terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>La derni\u00e8re affirmation est p\u00e9remptoire mais rien ne le prouve. Si WotC dispara\u00eet et se fait racheter par une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la licence peut \u00eatre termin\u00e9e.</p> <p>Mais, au final, est-ce si grave ? Non (voir ci-dessous).</p> <p>\u00a714. Reformation: If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p> <p>\u00a715.

Notre analyse portera uniquement sur l'application de cette licence au monde des JDR (et plus particuli\u00e8rement au SRD).</p> <p>To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions [...]</p> <p>L'aspect contractuel de la licence est expliqu\u00e9 en pr\u00e9ambule.</p> <p>Dans les d\u00e9finitions, on voit de suite que la licence CC-BY-4.0 (CC4 pour faire plus court) n'est pas pens\u00e9e pour le sujet du jeu de r\u00f4le, soit pour une \u0153uvre \u00e9tant un m\u00e9lange de contenus \"litt\u00e9raires\" dont (au regard de la loi am\u00e9ricaine) une partie poss\u00e8de des droits et est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le copyright (les personnages nomm\u00e9s, les histoires, les lieux, etc.) et une partie ne l'est pas (les r\u00e8gles du jeu).</p> <p>La licence CC4 ne propose que deux concepts concernant les contenus :</p> <ul> <li>Licensed Material : le contenu qui est ouvert, sur lequel celui qui poss\u00e8de les droits les partage \u00e0 l'autres ;</li> <li>Adapted Material : ce que les autres font avec ce contenu.</li> </ul> <p>La licence repousse le probl\u00e8me des deux types de contenus du Adapted Material, ceux sous copyright et ceux sans, \u00e0 la licence que va employer l'utilisateur des contenus sous CC4.</p> <p>1.b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p> <p>Comme dans le droit am\u00e9ricain, celui qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un contenu d\u00e9riv\u00e9 poss\u00e8de un copyright sur ses contributions seulement (pas sur le contenu original bien s\u00fbr).</p> <p>2.a.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</p> <ul> <li>reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and</li> <li>produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</li> </ul> <p>Cet article montre les droits donn\u00e9s par cette licence. Il est possible de faire ce que l'on souhaite avec le contenu original dans le monde entier et sans payer de royalties si tant est que l'on respecte les conditions d'attribution de la licence, soit que l'on nomme le cr\u00e9ateur original.</p> <p>2.a.5. paragraph 2. No downstream restrictions . You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.</p> <p>En effet, au regard du droit US sur le copyright, il n'est pas possible d'imposer des contraintes diff\u00e9rentes ou suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la licence du contenu original (Licensed Material).</p> <p>La question est : est-ce que ce contenu est CC4 et donc doit rester CC4 dans toutes les it\u00e9rations, notamment dans les liens entre un B et un C au titre du sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus.</p> <p>2.b.3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.</p> <p>\"To the extend possible\" veut dire \"dans la mesure du possible\", ce qui n'est pas tr\u00e8s rassurant. Mais la deuxi\u00e8me partie de l'article pr\u00e9cise que les r\u00e9serves concernant le fait que celui qui ouvre son contenu veuille des royalties doivent \u00eatre explicites.</p> <p>J'avoue que cet article me laisse un peu perplexe. Si quelqu'un peut prouver devant un tribunal que, parce que sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait menac\u00e9e de faillite, alors il a chang\u00e9 son mode de licensing pour collecter des droits, nous serions dans l'incertitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e par cette condition \"dans la mesure du possible\".</p> <p>Nous arrivons l\u00e0 au c\u0153ur du probl\u00e8me. On lit dans la partie Attribution les conditions de l'exploitation de la licence :</p> <p>3.a.1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:</p> <p>A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:</p> <p>i.identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);</p> <p>ii. a copyright notice;</p> <p>La notice du copyright est \u00e9videmment la notice du copyright du propri\u00e9taire du contenu original. Ce fait est tr\u00e8s important : la licence CC4 donne le droit d'exploitation du contenu mais ne change pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce dernier. Cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 reste soumise au copyright.</p> <p>Or, pour les jeux de r\u00f4les, la jurisprudence am\u00e9ricaine consid\u00e8re que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne s'applique qu'\u00e0 une partie du contenu original : la partie non relative aux r\u00e8gles du jeu.</p> <p>Demander un copyright sur le contenu devient donc, dans le cadre des jeux, une mention ambigu\u00eb : les r\u00e8gles D20 ne sont pas sous copyright alors que le terme D20 est une trademark et les Forgotten Realms le sont.</p> <p>Dans le cadre d'un SRD ne publiant que des r\u00e8gles, nous avons vu ci-dessus qu'il \u00e9tait inutile de rappeler que les r\u00e8gles du SRD \u00e9taient copyright WotC alors que des r\u00e8gles ne peuvent pas porter de copyright. Il est \u00e9galement inutile de cr\u00e9diter les auteurs.</p> <p>iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;</p> <p>iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;</p> <p>v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;</p> <p>B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and</p> <p>C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.</p> <p>Voil\u00e0 ce que demande WotC dans le SRD 5.1 de D&amp;D en version CC4 en terme de cr\u00e9dits :</p> <p>The System Reference Document 5.1 is provided to you free of charge under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (\u201cCC-BY-4.0\u201d).

The SRD 5.1 is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.</p> <p>Il est tr\u00e8s amusant que WotC ne demande pas de citer son copyright. Pourquoi ? Parce que ces derniers savent que le contenu du SRD n'est pas soumis au copyright ! Il utilisent donc la fa\u00e7on courante CC4 d'attribuer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \"by WotC\" qui n'a aucune valeur juridique et qui maintient l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9.</p> <p>Voir ici : Sometimes, the author will also provide a copyright notice, which consists of the copyright symbol, year of publication, and the name of the author/licensor. Include the copyright notice as a part of your attribution if such information is provided.</p> <p>Comme WotC impose des choses sur son contenu, ils auraient d\u00fb imposer de cr\u00e9diter leur copyright. Or ils ne le font pas, tout simplement parce qu'ils n'en ont pas sur cette partie.</p> <p>Cela signifie qu'ils savent que le point de vue d\u00e9fendu par cet article est vrai mais que, tant que les choses marchent, ils continuent \u00e0 faire illusion !</p> <p>Please do not include any other attribution regarding Wizards other than that provided above. You may, however, include a statement on your work that it is \u201ccompatible with fifth edition\u201d or \u201c5E compatible.\u201d</p> <p>Section 5 of CC-BY-4.0 includes a Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability that limits our liability to you.</p> <p>Notons que, dans cette version, WotC ouvre sa simili-trademark \"5e\" ou \"Fifth Edition\", cela facilite l'identification des produits, ce qui est une bonne chose.</p> <p>Mais l\u00e0 encore, WotC enfonce une porte ouverte : \"5e\" ou \"Fifth edition\" ne peut pas faire l'objet d'une vraie trademark en raison de son caract\u00e8re vraiment trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rique.</p> <p>Seul Googman Games avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une trademark sur Fifth Edition Fantasy mais l'a abandonn\u00e9 en juin 2023.</p> <p>Mais revenons \u00e0 la licence CC4.</p> <p>3.a.3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.</p> <p>Cet article pr\u00e9cise que le cr\u00e9ateur du contenu original a quand m\u00eame des droits sur ce contenu, au point de pouvoir modifier la mention. Dans la mention demand\u00e9e par WotC, mention sans copyright original, on peut assumer que WotC a implicitement utilis\u00e9 cet article pour ne pas indiquer que le contenu du SRD \u00e9tait soumis au copyright.</p> <p>3.a.4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.</p> <p>Pour la troisi\u00e8me fois, la licence indique que le contenu original est toujours sous la licence CC4 et que ce contenu doit rester sous la licence CC4. Nous dirons que nous sommes dans une \"contamination partielle\" port\u00e9e par la licence.</p> <p>Nous avons vu que la licence CC4 est li\u00e9e au copyright original, ce qui est normal. Cela a pour implication :</p> <p>Term and Termination.</p> <p>a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.</p> <p>Voil\u00e0 la cons\u00e9quence naturelle : si les droits se terminent, la licence CC4 devient caduque et il n'est plus possible d'exploiter le contenu. Le copyright est un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par une entit\u00e9 qui a sa dur\u00e9e de vie. Comme toute licence, le possesseur du copyright peut la terminer s'il le souhaite.</p>","tags":["Adventures in Middle-Earth","Basic Roleplaying System","Black Flag","Black Hack","Call of Cthulhu","Chaosium","D&D","Dark Sun","Dune RPG","Goodman Games","GURPS","H\u00e9ros & Dragons","Indiana Jones RPG","Kobold Press","Men in Black RPG","Middle-Earth Role Playing","Paizo","Pathfinder","Star Wars","Tales of the Valiant","The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game","The One Ring","Traveller","Wizards of the Coast"]},{"location":"pages/licences/#cc4-ou-ogl-meme-combat","title":"CC4 ou OGL, m\u00eame combat","text":"<p>En fait, nous en sommes au m\u00eame point.

Access and substantial similarity will not be enough to prove a breach of this Section 3.</p> <p>Ils ne manquent pas d'air et veulent faire le proc\u00e8s et ses conclusions dans la licence. Hasbro et WotC sont-ils au courant qu'ils sont dans un \u00e9tat souverain avec des lois auxquelles ils sont soumis ?</p> <p>\u00a74. WHAT WE OWN. We own Our Licensed Content and reserve all rights not expressly granted in this license.</p> <p>N-i\u00e8me redite de la m\u00eame chose.</p> <p>\u00a75. YOU CONTROL YOUR CONTENT. You can make your Content available under any terms you choose </p> <p>C'est une nouveaut\u00e9 bienvenue en comparaison des sous-entendus de la version 1.0a. Oui, dans le cadre de la loi sur le copyright, il est possible de faire les licences et les transferts de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que le possesseur de la licence souhaite.</p> <p>but you may not change the terms under which we make Our Licensed Content available.</p> <p>Le contenu original de WotC reste en licence OGL V1.2.</p> <p>(a) You must clearly indicate that your Licensed Work contains Our Licensed Content under this license either by including the full text of this license in your Licensed Work or by applying the Creator Products badge in compliance with the then-current style guidelines.</p> <p>Clairement, WotC demandait des choses inacceptables quant au style impos\u00e9 sur les \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es.</p> <p>Il serait int\u00e9ressant de consulter un sp\u00e9cialiste du droit du copyright pour savoir s'il est possible de donner l'usage d'un contenu tout en contraignant la forme. De ce que j'ai lu, je ne me souviens pas d'avoir vu ce genre de contraintes (\u00e0 part la mise en place d'un logo par exemple). Il n'est pas certain que cette clause de forme soit d\u00e9fendable en proc\u00e8s et ne soit pas, pour des produits aussi artistiques que les livres de JDR d'aujourd'hui, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme inacceptable et remettant en cause le Product Identity du r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence.</p> <p>(b) You may permit the use of your Content on any terms you want. However, if any license you offer to your Licensed Work is different from the terms of this license, you must include in the Licensed Work the attribution for Our Licensed Content found in the preamble to the applicable SRD, and make clear that Our Licensed Content included in your Licensed Work is made available on the terms of this license.</p> <p>Cette demande est l\u00e9gitime et conforme au droit du copyright et des \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es.</p> <p>\u00a76. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS. You represent and warrant that:</p> <p>(a) Age and Capacity to Be Bound. You are over the age of majority or, if younger, have had your parent or guardian review these terms and agree to them on your behalf.</p> <p>Etrange remarque dans un contrat.</p> <p>(b) Authority. You have the power and authority to enter into this license and perform its obligations.</p> <p>(c) No Infringement. Your Licensed Works do not and will not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights or any of our rights not licensed to you via this license or any other.</p> <p>WotC tente de se prot\u00e9ger, mais en faisant signer des d\u00e9clarations vagues.</p> <p>(d) No Endorsement. Except as otherwise expressly allowed by this license, you will not state, suggest, or imply that Your Licensed Works are endorsed by or associated with us.</p> <p>Mention classique.</p> <p>(e) No Illegal Conduct. You will not violate the law in any way relating to this license or Your Licensed Works.</p> <p>Cette mention a au moins le m\u00e9rite de la na\u00efvet\u00e9.</p> <p>(f) No Hateful Content or Conduct. You will not include content in Your Licensed Works that is harmful, discriminatory, illegal, obscene, or harassing, or engage in conduct that is harmful, discriminatory, illegal, obscene, or harassing. We have the sole right to decide what conduct or content is hateful, and you covenant that you will not contest any such determination via any suit or other legal action.</p> <p>Cette contrainte, encore une fois, est inacceptable. Il n'appartient pas \u00e0 WotC \u00e0 juger du respect de la loi.</p> <p>Cette partie 6 a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 absurde. Dans la partie Warranty g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui licencie son contenu doit se prot\u00e9ger en disant que tout ce qui peut arriver n'est pas de sa faute, en gros que tout ce qui peut se faire de mal avec son contenu n'est plus de sa responsabilit\u00e9.</p> <p>En lieu et place, WotC fait signer un contrat d'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 une plateforme de type r\u00e9seau social en obligeant les r\u00e9cipiendaires de licences \u00e0 accepter des r\u00e8gles dont ils doivent rendre compte devant WotC. C'est une confusion des genres.</p> <p>\u00a77 MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION</p> <p>(a) Modification. We may only modify the provisions of this license identifying the attribution required under Section 5 and the notice provision of Section 9(a). We may not modify any other provision.</p> <p>Cette d\u00e9claration n'a aucune valeur.</p> <p>(b) Termination</p> <p>(i) We may immediately terminate your license if you infringe any of our intellectual property; bring an action challenging our ownership of Our Licensed Content, trademarks, or patents; violate any law in relation to your activities under this license; or violate Section 6(f).</p> <p>Oui comme dans un r\u00e9seau social.</p> <p>(ii) We may terminate your license if you breach any other term in this license, and do not cure that breach within 30 days of notice to you of the breach.</p> <p>\u00a78. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE LICENSED CONTENT \u201cAS IS\u201d AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND CONCERNING YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED CONTENT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. YOU BEAR ALL RISK OF USING THE LICENSED CONTENT AND SUCH USE IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK. We have no liability to you for any types of damages in connection with your use of Our Licensed Content including without limitation any indirect, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, so long as our conduct at issue was not grossly negligent or intentional.</p> <p>Voil\u00e0 la fameuse mention que nous mentionnions auparavant. Elle est totalement suffisante dans une licence en lieu et place de la section 6.</p> <p>\u00a79.MISCELLANEOUS</p> <p>(a) Notices. We may notify you by any email or physical address we can locate for you. Only if we cannot locate your email or physical address after a reasonable search, notice via a public channel is sufficient. You may provide notice to us of your email or physical address, or any other notice, by emailing oglnotices@wizards.com.</p> <p>(b) Entire Agreement and Disclaimer of Reliance. This license governs your use of Our Licensed Content. This license consists only of the terms expressly included herein, and not any matter not expressly included herein. In accepting this license, you represent and warrant to us that you have relied only on the terms of the license and the advice of your own counsel, if any; you have not relied on anything that is not expressly a part of this license.</p> <p>Verbiage pseudo-juridique redondant avec de multiples endroits dans cette licence.</p> <p>(c) No Waiver of Rights. If we fail to exercise any right we have under this license, that failure will not prevent us from exercising that right in the future.</p> <p>Cela ne veut rien dire.</p> <p>(d) Severability. If any part of this license is held to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, Wizards may declare the entire license void, either as between it and the party that obtained the ruling or in its entirety. Unless Wizards elects to do so, the balance of this license will be enforced as if that part which is unenforceable or invalid did not exist.</p> <p>On sent que les personnes qui ont \u00e9crit cette licence n'ont pas confiance en eux.</p> <p>(e) Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Class Action Waiver. This license and all matters relating to its interpretation and enforcement will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and any disputes arising out of or relating to this license will be resolved solely and exclusively through individual litigation in the state or federal courts located in the county in which Wizards (or any successor) has its headquarters, and the parties expressly consent to the jurisdiction of such courts. Each party hereto irrevocably waives the right to participate in any class, collective, or other joint action with respect to such a dispute.</p> <p>N'importe quoi. Encore une fois, WotC ne peut pas faire signer \u00e0 quelqu'un qu'il s'engage \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 ses droits l\u00e9gaux en cas de litige. C'est absurde.</p> <p>Il s'agit probablement d'une clause copi\u00e9e et coll\u00e9e d'un contrat commercial entre deux entreprises, clause totalement hors sujet dans le cadre de cette licence.</p> <p>(f) Headings and Footnotes. The headings and footnotes contained in this license are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this license.</p> <p>Mention inutile.</p> <p>(g) Waiver of Jury Trial. We and you each waive any right to a jury trial of any dispute, claim or cause of action related to or arising out of this license.</p> <p>M\u00eame remarque qu'auparavant. Il est impossible de renoncer \u00e0 ses droits l\u00e9gaux dans le cadre d'une licence.</p> <p>(h) Review by Counsel. You should seek advice of counsel to make sure you understand this license. You agree that you had the opportunity to do so.</p> <p>Mention parfaitement stupide.</p>","tags":["Adventures in Middle-Earth","Basic Roleplaying System","Black Flag","Black Hack","Call of Cthulhu","Chaosium","D&D","Dark Sun","Dune RPG","Goodman Games","GURPS","H\u00e9ros & Dragons","Indiana Jones RPG","Kobold Press","Men in Black RPG","Middle-Earth Role Playing","Paizo","Pathfinder","Star Wars","Tales of the Valiant","The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game","The One Ring","Traveller","Wizards of the Coast"]},{"location":"pages/licences/#confusion-a-tous-les-etages","title":"Confusion \u00e0 tous les \u00e9tages","text":"<p>Osons le dire, ce draft for discussion purposes est un torchon !

Certes, la licence ORC est plus pr\u00e9cise en distinguant bien les trois types de contenus, mais est-ce si important ?</p> <p>Car la vraie question derri\u00e8re toute cette histoire est quand m\u00eame : est-il important qu'une licence soit poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par celui qui l'utilise pour ouvrir son contenu ?</p> <p>Parce que, si nous revenons aux fondamentaux, regardons ce que font les ayant-droits de Tolkien avec leurs licences exclusives JDR :</p> <ul> <li>Ils signent des accords du dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e avec des entreprises de jeu ;</li> <li>Ils doivent sans doute mettre des crit\u00e8res sur les produits d\u00e9riv\u00e9s, notamment le respect de l'\u0153uvre, du monde, etc. ;</li> <li>Ils n\u00e9gocient des royalties ;</li> <li>Il est probable que la licence poss\u00e8de des conditions de sortie pr\u00e9matur\u00e9es pour le cas o\u00f9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des licences s'av\u00e8re incomp\u00e9tente ou en faillite par exemple.</li> </ul> <p>Certes, WotC ne publie pas ses contenus Product Identity en publiant un SRD en CC4, mais il est quand m\u00eame normal que cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 elle veut le faire, que ce soit pour de bonnes ou de mauvaises raisons, d\u00e9crive les termes qui l'arrangent dans la mesure o\u00f9 il se peut qu'elle croie honn\u00eatement (ce dont je doute mais supposons) qu'elle permette \u00e0 l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me de profiter de son IP (Intellectual Property) gratuitement.</p> <p>Dans la d\u00e9marche, l'utilisation en cascade de la licence OGL est un peu \u00e9trange, car un certain nombre de termes de cette licence ne sont pas adapt\u00e9s aux \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es, mais il n'est pas choquant que, si on suppose que WotC cro\u00eet partager son copyright, ces derniers s'arrogent le droit (qu'ils ont du fait de la loi sur le copyright !) de changer la licence voire de la rendre obsol\u00e8te (cf. article 9).</p> <p>Pour ce qui est des autres compagnies, que cherchent-elles vraiment ?</p> <p>Si elles cherchent \u00e0 construire sur un socle fiable dans le temps, ces derni\u00e8res risqueront toujours de suivre WotC qui, en raison de ses marques et de son aura, et aussi d'une bonne qualit\u00e9 de ses produits, reconnaissons-le, aura toujours une version d'avance. Pour ceux qui ont mis\u00e9 sur le D20 voil\u00e0 20 ans et sur le SRD 3.5, ils peuvent continuer de tenter de vendre des produits, car c'est possible. Ce n'est jute plus vendable...</p> <p>...Plus vendable hormis pour Paizo qui, avec Pathfinder 2e, a fait le choix de rester dans la lign\u00e9e du SRD 3.5 avec une nouvelle branche qui enl\u00e8ve toute mention ambigu\u00eb pouvant les taxer d'atteinte au copyright de WotC. C'est finalement peut-\u00eatre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 la plus sens\u00e9e dans cette histoire car elle a vis\u00e9 le fond du probl\u00e8me : r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer toutes les r\u00e8gles qu'elle voulait, car ces r\u00e8gles \u00e9taient du domaine public, et changer les d\u00e9nominations pour \u00e9viter toute exposition \u00e0 un potentiel risque de Product Identity. Elle peut donc maintenant travailler sans d\u00e9pendance par rapport \u00e0 WotC. Pour autant, les r\u00e8gles de Pathfinder 2e, elles-aussi, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre soumises au copyright !</p> <p>Mais les autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, que veulent-elles \u00e0 part vouloir vendre des produits 5e avec le contenu du SRD 5.1 ouvert, pas de royalties et pas de risque juridique ?

Il indique que le nouvel auteur peut r\u00e9utiliser les illustrations en cr\u00e9ditant leur auteur.</p> <p>Pour que cela soit suffisant (le nouvel auteur respecte la CSL et c'est suffisant), il faudrait que les illustrations appartiennent \u00e0 Flynn. En effet, si les illustrations ne lui appartiennent pas, sa licence CSL ne peut pas se substituer \u00e0 la licence des images originales.</p> <p>Il aurait pu tourner les choses autrement, par exemple :</p> <p>Les images du Cepheus SRD sont soumises \u00e0 licence (voir page X du SRD pour la liste des cr\u00e9dits d'images). Si vous souhaitez les r\u00e9utiliser, veillez \u00e0 respecter les licences originales de ces images.</p> <p>Mais, dans ce cas, il n'aurait fait que rappeler la loi US sur le copyright (voir le cas de C dans notre exemple ci-dessus).</p> <p>En lieu et place, il introduit une ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 en faisant croire que le respect du \u00a76 de la licence CSL suffit \u00e0 \u00eatre conforme au droit, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Toute utilisation de contenu d\u00e9riv\u00e9 (hors r\u00e8gles) par un tiers doit \u00eatre fait dans le cadre d'une licence non-exclusive ou d'un transfert de droits (voir plus haut).</p> <p>\u00a77. Your rights under this CSL cannot be revoked, and are perpetual, unless you breach the terms of the license, in which case your rights terminate.</p> <p>Cette clause me met toujours mal \u00e0 l'aise. Le contenu appartient \u00e0 quelqu'un et ce dernier peut revendre les droits \u00e0 tout moment ; il peut mourir et donc c\u00e9der ses droits \u00e0 ses descendants ; etc.. Tout possesseur de droits peut mettre fin \u00e0 des licences existantes. Donc, cette clause n'est pas une garantie.</p> <p>La question reste le contenu, et potentiellement la dur\u00e9e du copyright avant que le contenu ne passe dans le domaine public (libre pour toujours dans ce cas).</p> <p>\u00a78. If you comply with the above, you may state that your resource is \u201cfor use with the Cepheus Engine Core Rules\u201d, \u201ccompatible with the core rules of Cepheus Engine\u201d or \u201cwith the Cepheus Engine Core Rules.\u201d</p> <p>Nous sommes bien sur une question de protection de trademark.</p> <p>Le gros probl\u00e8me de Cepheus est que la marque n'est pas enregistr\u00e9e (en classe 28) au niveau des marques US. Ainsi, la revendication de la filiation d'une trademark est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s dangereuse. En effet, tout tiers peut d\u00e9poser Cepheus en classe 28 quand il le souhaite et demander \u00e0 Jason Kemp de retirer tous ses produits de la vente pour infraction \u00e0 la loi sur les trademarks. Pour \u00e9conomiser 350$, certains auteurs de JDR prennent des risques bien grands.</p>","tags":["Adventures in Middle-Earth","Basic Roleplaying System","Black Flag","Black Hack","Call of Cthulhu","Chaosium","D&D","Dark Sun","Dune RPG","Goodman Games","GURPS","H\u00e9ros & Dragons","Indiana Jones RPG","Kobold Press","Men in Black RPG","Middle-Earth Role Playing","Paizo","Pathfinder","Star Wars","Tales of the Valiant","The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game","The One Ring","Traveller","Wizards of the Coast"]},{"location":"pages/licences/#conclusion_1","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Il est urgent que le monde du JDR m\u00fbrisse sur ces sujets.

Le jeu se joue avec des d6, m\u00eame s'il existe des variantes avec des d\u00e9s poly\u00e9driques.</p> <p>Le PJ est d\u00e9fini avec des arch\u00e9types (nomm\u00e9s Clich\u00e9s). Le joueur assigne 10d \u00e0 ses arch\u00e9types (maximum 5d par arch\u00e9type) (voir ici).</p> <p>Le principe du jet est de lancer tous les d\u00e9s de son Clich\u00e9 et d'additionner les r\u00e9sultats. En ce sens, le jeu fonctionne comme Ghostbusters et comme Star Wars 1e et 2e.</p> <p>Les actions simples sont g\u00e9r\u00e9es via une table de difficult\u00e9s. Pour les conflits, les parties doivent faire des jets en opposition, le plus grand total l'emporte et le perdant perd un d\u00e9 de Clich\u00e9 pour le round suivant. Ce m\u00e9canisme est \u00e0 la fois amusant, original mais r\u00e9put\u00e9 comme cr\u00e9ateur de la \"spirale de la mort\". Le jeu ne propose pas de PdV mais une perte de d\u00e9s de Clich\u00e9s \u00e0 la place.</p> <p>Un des aspects ludiques du jeu est la n\u00e9gociation entre le joueur et le MJ sur l'adaptation du Clich\u00e9 \u00e0 une situation. En effet, dans certains combats, le PJ peut ne pas avoir de Clich\u00e9 applicable ; il faut donc utiliser un \"Clich\u00e9 inappropri\u00e9\" mais convaincre pour cela le MJ que le Clich\u00e9 peut quand m\u00eame \u00eatre utilis\u00e9.</p> <p>Les Clich\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre \"gonfl\u00e9s\" (pump). Cela signifie qu'un joueur peut anticiper des pertes de d\u00e9s de Clich\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires lors d'un conflit pour gonfler son score. Si un PJ poss\u00e8de un Clich\u00e9 \u00e0 3d et qu'il perd un round, ce dernier se retrouvera \u00e0 2d. Si le joueur d\u00e9cide de booster son Clich\u00e9 de 1d, il lancera 4d pour ce round (3+1) mais perdra 2d s'il perd le round (1+1). S'il le gagne son adversaire perdra 2d : celui de la perte de round et celui de la gonflette de son adversaire !</p> <p>Les Clich\u00e9s deviennent donc une monnaie d'\u00e9change pour des actes h\u00e9ro\u00efques et risqu\u00e9s (voir ici).</p> <p>On notera aussi, dans le m\u00eame genre, la gestion des pouvoirs sp\u00e9ciaux comme la magie ou les pouvoirs psioniques. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les effets sont d\u00e9vastateurs au travers de la \"double gonflette\" (on investit Xd dans la gonflette mais celle-ci donne une augmentation de 2Xd au jet, tout en ne risquant que Xd en cas d'\u00e9chec), le co\u00fbt du Clich\u00e9 est double, par exemple 6 points pour un Clich\u00e9 N\u00e9cromant[3].</p> <p>Ce qui est, en un sens exceptionnel, est comment ce petit jeu inspir\u00e9 de Ghostbusters et utilis\u00e9 tout d'abord pour des tests est devenu un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne concentrant un certain nombre d'id\u00e9es dont certaines sont encore en vogue aujourd'hui. </p>","tags":["D&D","DCC","Dungeon Squad","Ghostbusters","GURPS","OSR","Risus","Shadowrun","Star Wars","USR"]},{"location":"pages/moteurs-simples/#usr","title":"USR","text":"Nom complet USR (Unbelievably Simple Role-playing) Auteur Scott Malthouse Date 2012 URL USR Style G\u00e9n\u00e9rique <p>Les personnages sont d\u00e9finis par 3 caract\u00e9ristiques :</p> <ul> <li>Action, pour tout ce qui est physique,</li> <li>Wits, pour tout ce qui est intelligence et perception,</li> <li>Ego, pour tout ce qui est relations sociales.</li> </ul> <p>Le joueur doit r\u00e9partir des d\u00e9s dans les diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques : d6, d8 et d10.</p> <p>On retrouve cette m\u00e9canique d'attribution de d\u00e9s \u00e0 des caract\u00e9ristiques dans de nombreux jeux (voir ici).</p> <p>Les PdV (Hits) sont d\u00e9riv\u00e9s : il faut lancer les d\u00e9s correspondant \u00e0 Action et \u00e0 Wits et additionner les deux.

Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 ma connaissance alors que les r\u00e8gles de OD&amp;D l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 : voir sur le tr\u00e8s bon site La Forge de papier.</p> <p>Il semble que ce soit la premi\u00e8re apparition des pouvoirs psychiques dans le monde du JDR. Leur apparition au sein de D&amp;D a quelque chose d'\u00e9trange, car on pourrait y voir une collision de diverses influences dans la fantasy: le m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique qui favorise la magie et les pouvoirs psychiques qui sent plus le JDR contemporain ou futuriste.</p> <p>D&amp;D propose les pouvoirs psy comme un genre de suppl\u00e9ment optionnel pour \"pimenter\" les parties. L'introduction de 1976 de Tim Kask dudit livre est amusante : </p> <p>L'introduction du combat psionique s'attache \u00e0 redynamiser des jeux devenus ternes. Cela ouvre des possibilit\u00e9s in\u00e9dites \u00e0 la fois pour les joueurs et le MD et, ce faisant, cela permet de se reconnecter \u00e0 l'un des th\u00e8mes favoris des \u00e9crivains de science-fiction et de fantasy : les pouvoirs inconnus de l'esprit.</p> <p>Pour autant, en lisant entre les lignes, l'introduction des d\u00e9mons dans le jeu semble pousser Gygax \u00e0 cr\u00e9er les r\u00e8gles des pouvoirs psychiques, mieux adapt\u00e9s, selon lui, \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les pouvoirs de certains d\u00e9mons.</p> <p>Comme souvent dans OD&amp;D, les r\u00e8gles sont confuses, incompl\u00e8tes, \u00e9clat\u00e9es dans le tout le livret, entrecoup\u00e9es de choses qui n'ont rien \u00e0 voir (le Druide, un syst\u00e8me de combat alternatif bas\u00e9 sur la Dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 Ajust\u00e9e, etc.).
