# What kind of dice?

The first point will be to decide what kind of dice use. I admit having a preference for standard RPG dices, and not D6, even if most of the quick tabletop RPG seem to be using D6.

For now, I will adopt a game system inspired by D&D but the blog is here to enable the reflection on the topic.
