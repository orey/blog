# Characteristics 2

## Present and Future

Let us continue the reflection started in the [previous entry](20200825-3.md), and address the Intuitive/Sensing Jungian traits.

We'll name those traits, currently: Present and Future.

The mechanism is quite similar from the one of Feel and Think:

* For your PC, at PC creation, you have one roll for Think/Feel: **roll 3D6** to get X;
* Choose if X goes to Present or to Future;
* Put 18-X in the other characteristic.

That leads to the following tables for Sandra and Vincent.

Sandra is living in the Present. Her player rolls 4+5+6=15 and assign the value to Present.

Characteristic | Present | Future 
--- | --- | ---
**Value** |  15 | 3 |

Vincent is rolling 3+2+7=12 and assign that
