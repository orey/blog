# What is the enterprise RPG you are talking about?

The enterprise is an hostile environment in which various set of skills are employed : technical ones, but also political ones. For decades, the enterprise landscape has changed, not really for the best, especially in big structures:

* Political skills are, more than ever, on the frontline;
* Technical skills seem to stay in the background;
* Nowadays, who is concerned about change management, or exact reporting?

This blogs starts a reflection around a **simulation system that would be adapted to simulate what's going on in modern enterprises** in which nothing can be called a failure anymore and everything is always a success, where intentions are too often sufficient.

This in-progress game aims to turn catastrophic situations in funny situations. If the exercise is successfull, you will be able :

* To create the PC (Player Characters) that correspond to your collegues;
* To predict the output of meetings and to create various kinds of "encounters";
* To determine who is the best PC or NPC (Non Player Character) to win a challenge or a contest;
* In one word, to play the roles of your colleagues.

In a certain way, this system _could be_ a RPG but would more be a way to have fun in the office with the RPG concepts adapted to the enterprise.

More to come.
