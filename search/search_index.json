GNU Free Documentation License # Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright \u00a9 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE # The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS # This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING # You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY # If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS # You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS # You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS # You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS # A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION # Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION # You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE # The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING # \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

COPYING IN QUANTITY"},{"location":"LICENSE/#4-modifications","text":"You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.","title":"4. MODIFICATIONS"},{"location":"LICENSE/#5-combining-documents","text":"You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".","title":"5.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.","title":"6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS"},{"location":"LICENSE/#7-aggregation-with-independent-works","text":"A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.","title":"7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS"},{"location":"LICENSE/#8-translation","text":"Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.

You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.","title":"8.

Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.","title":"9.

This game really marked the RPG world by violating many tabletop RPG principles: The game master is mandatory: In Mythic GME, he/she isn't anymore (even if sometimes a referee can be useful to decide on odds). The story must be determined before playing: In Mythic, you can play a story with just a starting idea. Randomness can be inserted intelligently at some key points in the story. The game engine is whatever you want, and globally, this is one element among others. With this story system, you can play solo. Mythic GME fostered the imagination of many players and game masters for almost 20 years, especially in the world of solo RPG. What is funny is that some old D&D tables determining, for instance, the way the NPCs react to the PCs can be used easily in a Mythic GME adventure. In some ways, many elements of well-known RPGs can be used in complement with the Fate Chart. I'm currently analyzing the Mythic GME extensions, Mythic Variation I and II, which propose new rules more adapted to the universes you play in, and more adapted to the kind of questions you're asking. September 22 2020 D&D and Gustav Mahler # For sure, there is no link between D&D and Mahler, except that they are various manifestations of the human culture, which is quite vague indeed. The fact is the digging into D&D history is, for me, haoppening at the same time as the digging into my old CDs of the Mahler symphonies. BTW, I miss the 6th for an unknown reason. I stopped listening to Mahler several years ago when I faced many personal troubles. In a certain way, the sadness of the 9th was talking to me, doing echo to my own pain. Those symphonies are associated to a certain period of my life that I don't recall with pleasure. Even if my role-playing phase is much older than Mahler symphonies, synchronicity seems to be there, as Jung would have say. Another Gustav... I created a repo to host the D&D 3.5 original texts, that I found in the Wayback Machine . The idea would be to publish the rough material in a browse-able way in order to progressively being able to integrate elements into programs. I have been struggling yesterday with the conversion of HTML to Markdown, problem for which I found a not-so-bad solution that I put in my stuff repo . The idea is to parse the HTML (generated from RTF by LibreOffice) and to replace tables with images. In a site that support dynamic images (like the ones we can generate with mkdocs ), the material will be mobile friendly. September 20 2020 D&D and the American appetite for wilderness # There is something peculiar about D&D, which could explain why I am not so fond of stories of people fighting with monsters in darks labyrinths. While reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grognardia , the huge attraction for \"wilderness\", which seems at the root of D&D, is a bit foreign to me. Maybe, the reason is cultural. In France, we have a long lasting past and everyone at school studies the Middle-Age, and the Greeks and Romans before that. In a certain way, a \"dungeon\" is just the biggest tower in a castle, where the lord used to live. Chivalry, in the French unconscious, is quite different than the picture that is depicted in D&D: knights have a law code and serve the widow and the orphan. They are often in love with a lady in a romantic way. They may face magic but not in the D&D sense. In a way, the Arthurian legend remains our reference. For a European eye, D&D looks like a western in tunnels with monsters as enemies, instead of Indians. I know, this is a bit provocative, but D&D is not at all a vision of chivalry, as we have traditionally in France. On the contrary: killing monsters, conquer territories and gain treasures to gain levels look, to me, as a caricature of the American dream. D&D element Element of American culture French traditional chivalry element Element of French culture Travel in the wilderness to conquer territories This really seems as the ideal of the Far West, which is typical American culture In French, chivalry, knight quests are for God or for a loved one. Conquering territories is no more considered as a positive thing (colonization is seen as a bad thing) Fight enemies and kill monsters The violence is part of American culture, as the fighting The notion of \"monster\" is present in the European legends but in small doses, probably due to Catholicism Violence is more psychological and verbal than real in French society (maybe because it is forbidden to have weapons) Gain treasure Typical American culture about earthly wealth, which is also typical from protestant countries The knights were fighting for an ideal and not for money, especially money coming from the murder and robbery of other living beings Catholic tradition that sees money as something dirty Gain experience and progress in the levels This can be seen as a real appetite for social ascension, and social competition This appetite also exists but not really in the chivalry tradition Social progression was also a feature of the Baby Boomers, being in the US or in Europe In other words, D&D is a very American game: A universe where violence and murder enables to progress in the society and become more powerful... Maybe that deserves more details than this quick simplistic psycho-analysis, but that may also explain why, for many French people, D&D is not very exciting. In France, we have this expression \"Gros Bill\" (\"Big Bill\") who is supposed to represent the super-hero knight, able to massacre everyone. If I saw many Gros-Bills, I never saw them craving for wilderness. Because we are old countries, most of us don't dream about conquest of the wild countries. For sure, D&D can be played like CoC, with more atmosphere and monsters that are so powerful that your should run instead of fighting. But, discovering progressively the roots of D&D, I think I progress in my understanding of why D&D is not my cup of tea. September 15 2020 Software help for RPGs? # For sure, dice are crucial to RPGs. But knowing that many role players play with tables, I am quite surprised of the \"paper orientation\" of the RPG world. It's obvious that the objective is not to create a graphical RPG, but it could be interesting, for instance, to have random tables managed digitally. Maybe my reflection is driven by some random game helps or by games like Mythic. But in some cases, being able to generate characters dynamically could be really interesting. Indeed, I am quite interested by the mix between random elements and driven elements. If we consider the old school gaming scenarios, the structure is quite often simple: A scenario introduction, with the plot (when there is a plot :), A location description, NPC (quite often monsters) and treasures description. In the case of the use of a GM emulator, easy software tools could be very interesting, something like a web page enabling to manage more complex randomness in a certain context . Interesting topic. September 10 2020 Autum's coming # I like Autumn. Living in the south of France, a very hot region in Summer, Autumn is the end of Summer and so the capacity of walking in the mountains again. The period is also the period of rough storms with heavy rain, which is changing after all those months of sunny and hot days. I just received the Dungeon's Master Guide of D&D 3e. I must admit I am a bit disappointed because the book is not old school, and appears to me as overproduced, nearer from a collection object than to a usable game. But well, I am used to D&D and I must go on. September 8 2020 The big director's roll # Well, I begin to play with dice at work, trying to predict what will happen. I faced today a really interesting case. Let me create the scene (maybe it is a wargame rather than a RPG): You have two teams, one is good and the other is bad. In a contract, each team wrote half of a document to present to a prospect. The overall material is bad, undoubtedly. The prospect screams saying: \"what kind of s**t is it?\" At first, the hierarchy laughs, saying : \"oh yes, no problem, everything's OK, just this stupid prospect that doesn't understand how smart we are. Well, after a while, probably after tectonic management movements (because the prospect reaction has a tendency to climb up the ladder), everyone would like to find a guilty person. For sure, the good team would be a good choice. Because, if the bad team survived, that means they have a specific protection charm that is not in line with their skills: maybe the charm is Not My Fault . So the attention gets to the good team that did a good job. The director of the bad team has a meeting tomorrow with the director of the good team. Indeed, as the team leader of the good team predicted it with his It Smells like Crap psionic power. Working from that prediction, the good team prepared the place for battle with many traps that are reinforced by the Hidden Truth potion. I calculated the odds of the bad director: 25% of being able to convince to good director, after all bonuses and penalties applied. I rolled a 98! Uh! Critical failure... We'll see tomorrow if my Oracle begins to work! September 7 2020 Getting public? # For now, this blog is quite hidden, which is nice. That enables me to dig into the recent (or less recent) RPG story. I kinda like to read the various game systems and compare them. I went recently through old stuff of mine: Simulacres , for instance which is a French game as I dislike them. The game system could have been innovative, but instead it is complicated and even a bit pretentious. I really dislike this feature in French personality: bragging as if French people had invented the hot water (French expression). Nevertheless, I love France and the French. But I would like to see more really creative stuff, playable stuff, modest, optimized, efficient, creative, straight to the point stuff, than those crappy \"I am the best and I teach you\" products. In the past, many game designers have indulged the pleasure of farting higher than their asses (other French expression, rather sympathetic this one), and I dislike it. I would say that Croc is probably one of a kind, that did not, or at least I don't remember. Maybe also the one who created the French RPG where you play lycanthropes. I'll find the name back. Well, the fact is, there are many RPGs that I find unplayable, but they don't feel as if they were lecturing me on something. That's the power of Americans. There is so much competition, that people try their best to do the best product. I see also a certain kind of \"focus\" in some American games. We're here for something particular: role-playing in a certain universe, and not benefiting from that tribune to insinuate political of social-crap stuff. A game is a game and no moral lesson from your grand-pa. September 7 2020 The winning couple for a RPG starting now with no preparation? # I analyzed extensively the Risus RPG (which is short so that didn't take much time) and created a flowchart to sum-up this micro-game (in French). Yes, my intention is to translate stuff when I can and when the license enables it. France is a great country for RPGs, even if I often find the French RPG a bit patronizing... As the French maybe. Anyway, in order to play without any preparation, nor at the game mechanics level, or at the scenario level, maybe the winning couple is Risus + Mythic . Risus is a funny game with very simple game mechanics, that are similar to some other mini-RPGs such as Cthulhu Dark ( French version ) or the children game FirstFable ( French version ) or even the very micro-game Roll for Shoes ( French version ). I think the emergence of mini-RPGs is the proof of some RPG players getting old. When you are young, you are keen to work hard in very large rule books. When you are older, you can run on the accumulated capacities of GM-ing that you have accumulated for so many years. The problem of older players is, for sure, the availability of other players. When everyone has its life, it's not so easy to meet. So, quite often, the sessions are scarcer, and with less players (unless you enroll your own children). For that, simple game engines can be a good way to address the rule part preparation. Remains the adventure itself for which you can use many tools: generators or even GM emulators if you really don't have the time to prepare a story. Concerning GM emulation, I think it would be great to use it inside a pre-existing universe. I have to investigate on that. September 7 2020 A very creative period # It's been a long time since I did not have a look to the RPG world, almost 25 years! For sure, I discovered that a multitude of RPGs and RPG engines were created in 25 years, and some of them seem to me as particularly notable. One of them is Mythic GM Emulator . This engine defined a new way to envisage to RPG by playing adventures with a level of randomness and possibly with no GM. I will write more about that game soon. I must admit that, a long time ago, I know many players that would have been greatly satisfied with that kind of engine. This creative period is very interesting because, for the RPG player and GM, there are plenty of offers, and most of them quite affordable. Many are Creative Commons or open source, or free. There is also the dominant position of DriveThruRPG as a global dealer of RPGs. I can see many great evolutions in the RPG universe in those last years : The development of Internet enabled many independant authors to create very interesting material, very often for a limited price. The development of print on demand enabled also to differentiate the selling of PDFs from the selling of printed manuals, which is great, considering the disappearance of many gaming shops (at least in France). The SRD 3.5 opened the door to re-interpretations of old school ways of playing RPGs, which can be a good thing. Games should offer many variations and attract several kinds of players. On this topic, I started reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grogniardia . It is very intesting and enables me to catch on with the RPG world. There are some good moments, in this blog, about the old school RPG gaming, mostly based on the the 2 first editions of D&D (OD&D and Holmes mainly). Even if I was never a player of D&D, the old school is talking to me. The age, maybe. The passion for CoC also where I find the same kind of objectives: play with not so many rules, have fun, and improvise. Maybe we are not so far from each other after all. The fact is, the period from 2000 to 2010 seems very creative, whereas I am not so sure that the following decade was (the one that is terminating now). I have to investigate. In some dimensions, I understand old school fanatics to be sad that things changed. But on the other hand, we still have many choices in the offer, so much actually that searching for the product that corresponds to you can be quite long. But I think we should not complain. It is just a new era of RPG with several generations playing the same kind of games and so expecting different things from it. For sure, everyone is not playing a single \"universal\" game, but, without being a specialist, when I see all the supplements produced by Paizo on PathFinder, I wonder if most players are not still concentrated on heroic-fantasy games around the D&D rules (being 3rd edition or another). September 7 2020 Dodge and parrying # This blog is also a pretext to speak about RPG, so that's what I'm going to do. There seem to be a way to open comments in this blog but I am not sure many people will be interested by the topic. If you are, contact me by mail. A long time ago, I played RPGs, mainly CoC, Warhammer, Parano\u00efa, Vampire, Kult, but also French games like Mega II , Bitume , Empire et Dynasties ou L\u00e9gendes . I was never a player of D&D. Recently, I have entered the RPG world again and try to catch up, especially with all the SRD and Open Gaming adventure. That initiative created PathFinder as a competitor to D&D. I'm reading some other rule books inheritated from the SRD 3.5, especially Basic Fantasy RPG , and OSRIC . Indeed, as I like the D20 system in general, I would like to inspire the Enterprise RPG gaming system from it. The fact is I find it very surprising that there seem to be no dodge or parrying system. In a round (let's says 10 seconds), I would have expected every PC to have at least 1 attack and 1 defense. For sure, the order in the combat sequence is depending upon initiative, which means that if you don't have the initiative, you can try to parry (with your shield or your weapon - BTW, weapon parrying power depends on the weapon because a stick is not a sword) or to dodge. Dodging should be the result of DEX and so have some bonus/malus coming from DEX and some bonus/malus coming from AC (it is more complex to dodge with a plate armor than without). Concerning parrying, it could be done at the same level that the attack, or to be some kind of contest versus the attack of the attacker. However, you should choose to parry with your shield or your weapon. For sure, I think the AC concept theoretically takes into account this fact, but I think it breaks the balance in combat. Let us suppose you are a Monk at level 12: You should be unreachable my most creatures, even if you don't attack and you just dodge. The fact of having 2 attacks per round would give you the same number of defenses. I even think you should be able to turn the attack in a defense if you need it, for instance when attacked by multiple enemies. I have to continue my investigations to see how dodge and parrying are treated in other rule books. I am not really in favor of dodging being a skill: it should be more part of the core combat system. I have to reply on a logical combat system that's why those investigations are interesting.

August 26 2020 Characteristics # Courtesy of istockphoto.com First inspiration: Jung Each character will have a set of characteristics and skills. I like the skills being specialization of characteristics. I wanted to start with the Jungiang traits. Roughly, Jung defines 3 kinds of attributes. If we adopt the perspective of Myers-Briggs (without adding the 4th trait), we can have: Introversion/Extraversion, which is the place from where people are taking their energy; Intuitive/Sensing, which is the perception of time, intuitive living in the future and being able to anticipate, and sensing living in the present; Thinkful/Feeling, which is the approach of conflict, or based on intellectual facts or based on feeling for people. In all cases, as the \"context\" (understand \"the enterprise the PC are into\") requires certain details on the \"mind characteristics\", we have to find a way to have balanced characteristics. First rules Let's take an example to enable to reflection. Sandra is a woman and she has an argument with Vincent, a man. Vincent is \"Feel\" oriented whereas Sandra is more \"Think\". Let us suppose that we have just one scale: Feel + Think should be a fixed number and Sandra would have much more chances to succeed in an analysis based on Think than an analysis based on Feel (and the reverse for Vincent). However: Those characteristics should both exist in both profiles and be linked together in some way; There is no reason for which those characteristics may be limited. So we can imagine the following rules: For your PC, at PC creation, you have one roll for Think/Feel: roll 3D6 to get X; Choose if X goes to Feel or to Think; Put 18-X in the other characteristic. The result would be for Sandra 3+6+4=13: Characteristic Feel Think Value 5 13 And for Vincent, 1+4+5=10: Characteristic Feel Think Value 10 8 This can enable the standard D20 roll against some threshold to succeed to not in a certain challenge.

This game really marked the RPG world by violating many tabletop RPG principles: The game master is mandatory: In Mythic GME, he/she isn't anymore (even if sometimes a referee can be useful to decide on odds). The story must be determined before playing: In Mythic, you can play a story with just a starting idea. Randomness can be inserted intelligently at some key points in the story. The game engine is whatever you want, and globally, this is one element among others. With this story system, you can play solo. Mythic GME fostered the imagination of many players and game masters for almost 20 years, especially in the world of solo RPG. What is funny is that some old D&D tables determining, for instance, the way the NPCs react to the PCs can be used easily in a Mythic GME adventure. In some ways, many elements of well-known RPGs can be used in complement with the Fate Chart. I'm currently analyzing the Mythic GME extensions, Mythic Variation I and II, which propose new rules more adapted to the universes you play in, and more adapted to the kind of questions you're asking.

The fact is the digging into D&D history is, for me, haoppening at the same time as the digging into my old CDs of the Mahler symphonies. BTW, I miss the 6th for an unknown reason. I stopped listening to Mahler several years ago when I faced many personal troubles. In a certain way, the sadness of the 9th was talking to me, doing echo to my own pain. Those symphonies are associated to a certain period of my life that I don't recall with pleasure. Even if my role-playing phase is much older than Mahler symphonies, synchronicity seems to be there, as Jung would have say. Another Gustav...

While reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grognardia , the huge attraction for \"wilderness\", which seems at the root of D&D, is a bit foreign to me. Maybe, the reason is cultural. In France, we have a long lasting past and everyone at school studies the Middle-Age, and the Greeks and Romans before that. In a certain way, a \"dungeon\" is just the biggest tower in a castle, where the lord used to live. Chivalry, in the French unconscious, is quite different than the picture that is depicted in D&D: knights have a law code and serve the widow and the orphan. They are often in love with a lady in a romantic way. They may face magic but not in the D&D sense. In a way, the Arthurian legend remains our reference. For a European eye, D&D looks like a western in tunnels with monsters as enemies, instead of Indians. I know, this is a bit provocative, but D&D is not at all a vision of chivalry, as we have traditionally in France. On the contrary: killing monsters, conquer territories and gain treasures to gain levels look, to me, as a caricature of the American dream. D&D element Element of American culture French traditional chivalry element Element of French culture Travel in the wilderness to conquer territories This really seems as the ideal of the Far West, which is typical American culture In French, chivalry, knight quests are for God or for a loved one. Conquering territories is no more considered as a positive thing (colonization is seen as a bad thing) Fight enemies and kill monsters The violence is part of American culture, as the fighting The notion of \"monster\" is present in the European legends but in small doses, probably due to Catholicism Violence is more psychological and verbal than real in French society (maybe because it is forbidden to have weapons) Gain treasure Typical American culture about earthly wealth, which is also typical from protestant countries The knights were fighting for an ideal and not for money, especially money coming from the murder and robbery of other living beings Catholic tradition that sees money as something dirty Gain experience and progress in the levels This can be seen as a real appetite for social ascension, and social competition This appetite also exists but not really in the chivalry tradition Social progression was also a feature of the Baby Boomers, being in the US or in Europe In other words, D&D is a very American game: A universe where violence and murder enables to progress in the society and become more powerful... Maybe that deserves more details than this quick simplistic psycho-analysis, but that may also explain why, for many French people, D&D is not very exciting. In France, we have this expression \"Gros Bill\" (\"Big Bill\") who is supposed to represent the super-hero knight, able to massacre everyone. If I saw many Gros-Bills, I never saw them craving for wilderness. Because we are old countries, most of us don't dream about conquest of the wild countries. For sure, D&D can be played like CoC, with more atmosphere and monsters that are so powerful that your should run instead of fighting. But, discovering progressively the roots of D&D, I think I progress in my understanding of why D&D is not my cup of tea.

But knowing that many role players play with tables, I am quite surprised of the \"paper orientation\" of the RPG world. It's obvious that the objective is not to create a graphical RPG, but it could be interesting, for instance, to have random tables managed digitally. Maybe my reflection is driven by some random game helps or by games like Mythic. But in some cases, being able to generate characters dynamically could be really interesting. Indeed, I am quite interested by the mix between random elements and driven elements. If we consider the old school gaming scenarios, the structure is quite often simple: A scenario introduction, with the plot (when there is a plot :), A location description, NPC (quite often monsters) and treasures description. In the case of the use of a GM emulator, easy software tools could be very interesting, something like a web page enabling to manage more complex randomness in a certain context . Interesting topic.

I faced today a really interesting case. Let me create the scene (maybe it is a wargame rather than a RPG): You have two teams, one is good and the other is bad. In a contract, each team wrote half of a document to present to a prospect. The overall material is bad, undoubtedly. The prospect screams saying: \"what kind of s**t is it?\" At first, the hierarchy laughs, saying : \"oh yes, no problem, everything's OK, just this stupid prospect that doesn't understand how smart we are. Well, after a while, probably after tectonic management movements (because the prospect reaction has a tendency to climb up the ladder), everyone would like to find a guilty person. For sure, the good team would be a good choice. Because, if the bad team survived, that means they have a specific protection charm that is not in line with their skills: maybe the charm is Not My Fault . So the attention gets to the good team that did a good job. The director of the bad team has a meeting tomorrow with the director of the good team.

That enables me to dig into the recent (or less recent) RPG story. I kinda like to read the various game systems and compare them. I went recently through old stuff of mine: Simulacres , for instance which is a French game as I dislike them. The game system could have been innovative, but instead it is complicated and even a bit pretentious. I really dislike this feature in French personality: bragging as if French people had invented the hot water (French expression). Nevertheless, I love France and the French. But I would like to see more really creative stuff, playable stuff, modest, optimized, efficient, creative, straight to the point stuff, than those crappy \"I am the best and I teach you\" products. In the past, many game designers have indulged the pleasure of farting higher than their asses (other French expression, rather sympathetic this one), and I dislike it. I would say that Croc is probably one of a kind, that did not, or at least I don't remember. Maybe also the one who created the French RPG where you play lycanthropes. I'll find the name back. Well, the fact is, there are many RPGs that I find unplayable, but they don't feel as if they were lecturing me on something. That's the power of Americans. There is so much competition, that people try their best to do the best product. I see also a certain kind of \"focus\" in some American games. We're here for something particular: role-playing in a certain universe, and not benefiting from that tribune to insinuate political of social-crap stuff.

Yes, my intention is to translate stuff when I can and when the license enables it. France is a great country for RPGs, even if I often find the French RPG a bit patronizing... As the French maybe. Anyway, in order to play without any preparation, nor at the game mechanics level, or at the scenario level, maybe the winning couple is Risus + Mythic . Risus is a funny game with very simple game mechanics, that are similar to some other mini-RPGs such as Cthulhu Dark ( French version ) or the children game FirstFable ( French version ) or even the very micro-game Roll for Shoes ( French version ). I think the emergence of mini-RPGs is the proof of some RPG players getting old. When you are young, you are keen to work hard in very large rule books. When you are older, you can run on the accumulated capacities of GM-ing that you have accumulated for so many years. The problem of older players is, for sure, the availability of other players. When everyone has its life, it's not so easy to meet. So, quite often, the sessions are scarcer, and with less players (unless you enroll your own children). For that, simple game engines can be a good way to address the rule part preparation. Remains the adventure itself for which you can use many tools: generators or even GM emulators if you really don't have the time to prepare a story. Concerning GM emulation, I think it would be great to use it inside a pre-existing universe. I have to investigate on that.

For sure, I discovered that a multitude of RPGs and RPG engines were created in 25 years, and some of them seem to me as particularly notable. One of them is Mythic GM Emulator . This engine defined a new way to envisage to RPG by playing adventures with a level of randomness and possibly with no GM. I will write more about that game soon. I must admit that, a long time ago, I know many players that would have been greatly satisfied with that kind of engine. This creative period is very interesting because, for the RPG player and GM, there are plenty of offers, and most of them quite affordable. Many are Creative Commons or open source, or free. There is also the dominant position of DriveThruRPG as a global dealer of RPGs. I can see many great evolutions in the RPG universe in those last years : The development of Internet enabled many independant authors to create very interesting material, very often for a limited price. The development of print on demand enabled also to differentiate the selling of PDFs from the selling of printed manuals, which is great, considering the disappearance of many gaming shops (at least in France). The SRD 3.5 opened the door to re-interpretations of old school ways of playing RPGs, which can be a good thing. Games should offer many variations and attract several kinds of players. On this topic, I started reading the blog of James Maliszewski, Grogniardia . It is very intesting and enables me to catch on with the RPG world. There are some good moments, in this blog, about the old school RPG gaming, mostly based on the the 2 first editions of D&D (OD&D and Holmes mainly). Even if I was never a player of D&D, the old school is talking to me. The age, maybe. The passion for CoC also where I find the same kind of objectives: play with not so many rules, have fun, and improvise. Maybe we are not so far from each other after all. The fact is, the period from 2000 to 2010 seems very creative, whereas I am not so sure that the following decade was (the one that is terminating now). I have to investigate. In some dimensions, I understand old school fanatics to be sad that things changed. But on the other hand, we still have many choices in the offer, so much actually that searching for the product that corresponds to you can be quite long. But I think we should not complain. It is just a new era of RPG with several generations playing the same kind of games and so expecting different things from it. For sure, everyone is not playing a single \"universal\" game, but, without being a specialist, when I see all the supplements produced by Paizo on PathFinder, I wonder if most players are not still concentrated on heroic-fantasy games around the D&D rules (being 3rd edition or another).

A long time ago, I played RPGs, mainly CoC, Warhammer, Parano\u00efa, Vampire, Kult, but also French games like Mega II , Bitume , Empire et Dynasties ou L\u00e9gendes . I was never a player of D&D.

Cela m'a bien fait rire car je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 un grand fan du Seigneur des Anneaux. A l'\u00e9poque, les fans hyst\u00e9riques de Tolkien tentaient de me convaincre de l'immensit\u00e9 de ce livre, et des autres (encore plus pourris). Je les provoquais en leur disant que Tolkien avait tout pomp\u00e9 sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de Wagner des l\u00e9gendes germaniques, ce qui est malheureusement vrai. D\u00e8s qu'un truc est cool dans le SdA, c'est pas de Tolkien : L'Anneau maudit des Nibelung est le c\u0153ur de la L\u00e9gende du m\u00eame nom (Tolkien a pomp\u00e9 l'intrigue principale soit l'anneau maudit) ; Le heaume magique rend invisible est forg\u00e9 avec le m\u00eame or (Tolkien a pris le pouvoir et l'a attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'anneau, quelle inventivit\u00e9 d\u00e9moniaque !) ; L'anneau suscite des convoitises allant jusqu'au meurtre (motif que Tolkien a repris brut de fonderie) ; L'anneau trouv\u00e9 dans la caverne est gard\u00e9 par un dragon tu\u00e9 par Siegfried (chez Tolkien, c'est Bilbo qui gagne l'anneau aux devinettes en flouant Golum, ne me dites pas que \u00e7a ne craint pas) ; L'\u00e9p\u00e9e bris\u00e9e qui fut reforg\u00e9e, c'est celle de Siegfried (et pas celle d'Isildur, petit pompeur) ; Etc. En fait, dans la T\u00e9tralogie (L'Or du Rhin, la Walkyrie, Siegfried, le Cr\u00e9puscule des Dieux), tout est mieux que chez Tolkien : La mal\u00e9diction a une raison profonde, le manque d'amour et le rejet du nain Alberich par les Filles du Rhin ; La convoitise touche les dieux, en particulier Wotan (Odin), qui se retrouve coinc\u00e9 dans des histoires de fesses et de promesses h\u00e2tives ; Il y a une dimension m\u00e9taphysique dans ce cycle, avec la mise en place d'un encha\u00eenement de causes et d'effets qui m\u00e8ne au cr\u00e9puscule des dieux. Chez Tolkien, tout est long et chiant. M\u00eame les m\u00e9chants sont chiants. Et je trouve que c'est bien rendu par les films qui sont vraiment chiants. L'histoire est niaise. Pourquoi aller d\u00e9truire l'anneau chez Sauron ? Raconter la guerre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e avec deux hobbits se baladant dans les Terres du Milieu, ouais, c'est un sc\u00e9nario un peu faiblard. Aucune dimension philosophique. Aucune dimension heroic-fantasy... Normal, le sieur Tolkien \u00e9tait un \u00e9rudit. Et les \u00e9rudits sont la plupart du temps des pompeurs car ils sont trop peu inventifs pour \u00e9crire quelque chose d'original (je parlerai un de ces quatre de Ecco). Alors, on peut planquer le tout sous des tonnes de mots, sous un langage elfique foireux et sous des tonnes de PNJ, mais il n'en demeure pas moins que \u00e7a reste nul. Une des dimensions les plus nulles de la s\u00e9rie est l'absence de sentiments. Les personnages sont vraiment nases et creux. Ils ne v\u00e9hiculent rien, aucun amour, aucun id\u00e9al, \u00e0 part buter Sauron. Leur confr\u00e9rie en carton p\u00e2te ne fait rien ressentir. Le SdA est un bouquin froid comme une table de dissection, celle de l'\u00e9rudit. Regardez les op\u00e9ras de Wagner (avec les sous-titres) et vous verrez ce que c'est qu'une l\u00e9gende heroic-fantasy avec des sentiments ! Enfin, tout \u00e7a pour dire que cet article m'a remis en m\u00e9moire le combat path\u00e9tique de Gandalf et de Saroumane dans le film. C'est nul.

Cela m'a bien fait rire car je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 un grand fan du Seigneur des Anneaux. A l'\u00e9poque, les fans hyst\u00e9riques de Tolkien tentaient de me convaincre de l'immensit\u00e9 de ce livre, et des autres (encore plus pourris). Je les provoquais en leur disant que Tolkien avait tout pomp\u00e9 sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de Wagner des l\u00e9gendes germaniques, ce qui est malheureusement vrai. D\u00e8s qu'un truc est cool dans le SdA, c'est pas de Tolkien : L'Anneau maudit des Nibelung est le c\u0153ur de la L\u00e9gende du m\u00eame nom (Tolkien a pomp\u00e9 l'intrigue principale soit l'anneau maudit) ; Le heaume magique rend invisible est forg\u00e9 avec le m\u00eame or (Tolkien a pris le pouvoir et l'a attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'anneau, quelle inventivit\u00e9 d\u00e9moniaque !) ; L'anneau suscite des convoitises allant jusqu'au meurtre (motif que Tolkien a repris brut de fonderie) ; L'anneau trouv\u00e9 dans la caverne est gard\u00e9 par un dragon tu\u00e9 par Siegfried (chez Tolkien, c'est Bilbo qui gagne l'anneau aux devinettes en flouant Golum, ne me dites pas que \u00e7a ne craint pas) ; L'\u00e9p\u00e9e bris\u00e9e qui fut reforg\u00e9e, c'est celle de Siegfried (et pas celle d'Isildur, petit pompeur) ; Etc. En fait, dans la T\u00e9tralogie (L'Or du Rhin, la Walkyrie, Siegfried, le Cr\u00e9puscule des Dieux), tout est mieux que chez Tolkien : La mal\u00e9diction a une raison profonde, le manque d'amour et le rejet du nain Alberich par les Filles du Rhin ; La convoitise touche les dieux, en particulier Wotan (Odin), qui se retrouve coinc\u00e9 dans des histoires de fesses et de promesses h\u00e2tives ; Il y a une dimension m\u00e9taphysique dans ce cycle, avec la mise en place d'un encha\u00eenement de causes et d'effets qui m\u00e8ne au cr\u00e9puscule des dieux. Chez Tolkien, tout est long et chiant. M\u00eame les m\u00e9chants sont chiants. Et je trouve que c'est bien rendu par les films qui sont vraiment chiants. L'histoire est niaise. Pourquoi aller d\u00e9truire l'anneau chez Sauron ? Raconter la guerre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e avec deux hobbits se baladant dans les Terres du Milieu, ouais, c'est un sc\u00e9nario un peu faiblard. Aucune dimension philosophique. Aucune dimension heroic-fantasy... Normal, le sieur Tolkien \u00e9tait un \u00e9rudit. Et les \u00e9rudits sont la plupart du temps des pompeurs car ils sont trop peu inventifs pour \u00e9crire quelque chose d'original (je parlerai un de ces quatre de Ecco). Alors, on peut planquer le tout sous des tonnes de mots, sous un langage elfique foireux et sous des tonnes de PNJ, mais il n'en demeure pas moins que \u00e7a reste nul. Une des dimensions les plus nulles de la s\u00e9rie est l'absence de sentiments. Les personnages sont vraiment nases et creux. Ils ne v\u00e9hiculent rien, aucun amour, aucun id\u00e9al, \u00e0 part buter Sauron. Leur confr\u00e9rie en carton p\u00e2te ne fait rien ressentir. Le SdA est un bouquin froid comme une table de dissection, celle de l'\u00e9rudit. Regardez les op\u00e9ras de Wagner (avec les sous-titres) et vous verrez ce que c'est qu'une l\u00e9gende heroic-fantasy avec des sentiments ! Enfin, tout \u00e7a pour dire que cet article m'a remis en m\u00e9moire le combat path\u00e9tique de Gandalf et de Saroumane dans le film. C'est nul. Et effectivement, c'est nul comme un combat de magiciens de niveau 5 dans un mauvais sc\u00e9nar de D&D !

Elles sont obtenues en additionnant deux ou trois caract\u00e9ristiques. Les tests sont des tests de pourcentages sous les Talents. L'Ultime Epreuve est un jeu simple et assez agr\u00e9able, au final assez compatible avec le Basic Roleplaying System de Chaosium.

L\u00e9gendes de la Val\u00e9e des Rois # L\u00e9gendes de la Vall\u00e9e des Rois Malgr\u00e9 ma critique de la gamme L\u00e9gendes , j'ai lu consciencieusement les deux livres de ce jeu que je ne connaissais pas trop. Un jeu injouable # Le livre de civilisation est pas mal fait, quoique totalement descriptif. On pourra regretter le manque total de pistes d'intrigues, ou d'id\u00e9es de sc\u00e9narios. On est vraiment dans le suppl\u00e9ment historique, et c'est vraiment dommage. Le sc\u00e9nario est \u00e0 l'avenant : court, simpliste, et insuffisant pour b\u00e2tir des personnages qui ont des aventures sur plusieurs sessions. L\u00e0, la barre est tr\u00e8s haute et s'adresse \u00e0 des MJs chevronn\u00e9s (je ne parle que de l'univers) et des joueurs passionn\u00e9s. On peut reprendre la table d'accessibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9finie ici . Jeu Access. Monde Access. Magie Motivation fondamentale Complexit\u00e9 jeu Accessibilit\u00e9 L\u00e9gendes de la Vall\u00e9e des Rois Difficile (u)(1) Difficile (v)(1) Difficile (w)(1) Difficile (1) 1.00 /4 Table 1 : Accessibilit\u00e9 des L\u00e9gendes de la Vall\u00e9e des Rois On voit bien la marque de fabrique de L\u00e9gendes ... Le livre de r\u00e8gles est un ouvrage bizarre. Au d\u00e9but, on pourrait penser que les r\u00e8gles sont simples, mais progressivement, les r\u00e8gles se complexifient jusqu'\u00e0 devenir franchement complexes, m\u00eame pour la cr\u00e9ation des personnages. La magie montre un r\u00e9el travail, mais n\u00e9cessitant un \u00e9norme effort de mise en pratique. Et puis, avec les deux types de magie correspondant grosso modo aux deux classes sociales, comment constituer un ensemble homog\u00e8ne. Ce qui est intrigant avec ce genre de jeux, c'est que l'on se demande s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 play-test\u00e9. O\u00f9 est l'aventure ou le myst\u00e8re quand on joue un savetier de la XVIII\u00e8me dynastie ? Je me demande s'il est possible de jouer autre chose que des personnages pr\u00e9-tir\u00e9s dans cet univers. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'une seconde \u00e9dition # Evidemment, si l'on faisait une seconde \u00e9dition, on pourrait tirer quelque chose du mat\u00e9riau original : Il faudrait simplifier drastiquement le syst\u00e8me de jeu, et pas forc\u00e9ment le contenu de fond, comme celui de la magie ; Il faudrait avoir des r\u00e8gles pour que les personnages soient dans un groupe social homog\u00e8ne (l\u00e0, on peut \u00eatre mendiant ou pharaon au tirage, ce qui ne permet pas de faire des groupes homog\u00e8nes, c'en est m\u00eame ridicule), ces r\u00e8gles devraient aussi donner des pistes pour des ensembles d'aventures de groupes et non proposer de jouer tous les m\u00e9tiers dans un univers historique ; Il faudrait penser un peu diff\u00e9remment la magie, car elle est tr\u00e8s complexe ; Il faudrait ajouter des id\u00e9es de sc\u00e9narios un peu partout dans la timeline historique. Le sujet religieux est aussi abord\u00e9 d'un point de vue historique. Cette partie est int\u00e9ressante, mais elle aurait pu \u00eatre rendue plus \"fantastique\" en mat\u00e9rialisant les divers Dieux le long du Nil dans les \u00e9v\u00e9nements historiques. Je veux dire, si l'on ne tisse pas les dieux dans l'histoire, les cr\u00e9atures \u00e0 t\u00eates d'animaux tombent un peu comme un cheveu sur la soupe. Il aurait fallu faire deux colonnes : les \u00e9v\u00e9nements historiques d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 et l'interpr\u00e9tation magique de l'autre. Cela me fait penser \u00e0 l'approche prise par Ars Magica : nous sommes bien dans le Moyen-Age historique, mais avec des mages qui ont des pouvoirs et une vision diff\u00e9rente de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Les options prises par GURPS # GURPS Egypt Si on compare, GURPS rame un peu quand m\u00eame dans cet univers antique \u00e9gyptien, mais fait le choix de simplifier le nombre de profils de PJs, la magie, etc., et d'ouvrir sur d'autres perspectives et d'autres suppl\u00e9ments de la gamme GURPS qui auraient besoin de backgrounds historiques pour des aventures se d\u00e9roulant en Egypte. Historiquement, c'est plus sommaire, mais c'est plus jouable et plus ouvert. Certes, on tombe vite dans les momies, dans un cas comme dans l'autre... C'est le c\u00f4t\u00e9 difficult\u00e9 de l'accessibilit\u00e9 du monde et de la magie. Pour les occidentaux que nous sommes, l'Egypte ancienne est quand m\u00eame lointaine et les arch\u00e9types connus de cette p\u00e9riode ne sont pas nombreux : pyramides, pharaons, momies... Y a-t-il des cr\u00e9ateurs dans la salle ? # Ca me donne un genre de go\u00fbt amer dans la bouche, car L\u00e9gendes de la Vall\u00e9e des Rois est un jeu fran\u00e7ais, et au final, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jou\u00e9 et, aujourd'hui non plus, il n'est plus jou\u00e9. Donc l'objectif n'est pas atteint. Apr\u00e8s, faut-il sauver tous les jeux ? Dans mes jeunes ann\u00e9es, on avait le choix entre deux types de jeux : Des traductions de jeux am\u00e9ricains, dont D&D et CoC , Des jeux fran\u00e7ais, dont L'Ultime Epreuve , L\u00e9gendes , M\u00e9ga , Empire Galactique , Mal\u00e9fices , R\u00eave de Dragon , Empire et Dynasties , Bitume , etc. Aujourd'hui, \u00e7a me semble plus compliqu\u00e9. On a beaucoup de traductions (que je trouve souvent pas top), pas mal de trucs issus de SRD am\u00e9ricains, \u00e0 commencer par les SRD de D&D 3.5e , et quelques r\u00e9\u00e9ditions squelettiques ou confidentielles de jeux fran\u00e7ais de l'\u00e9poque, je pense \u00e0 Mal\u00e9fices ou \u00e0 M\u00e9ga 5 .

Les jeux am\u00e9ricains ont conserv\u00e9 des empruntes durables parce qu'ils vivent, voire m\u00eame se r\u00e9p\u00e8tent \u00e0 chaque \u00e9dition : D&D , on en est \u00e0 la 5 ; CoC \u00e0 la 7 ; et tutti quanti .

Mais nous les fran\u00e7ais, on a du mal \u00e0 suivre nos jeux. Les jeux sont soutenus par leur auteur et puis apr\u00e8s, pouf, ils disparaissent.

Quoi que le jeu ait eu une r\u00e9putation de jeu hyper-complexe, en tant que MJ, je me souviens d'avoir cass\u00e9 ma tirelire pour acheter les r\u00e8gles compl\u00e8tes. Nous avions \u00e0 faire \u00e0 un jeu suppos\u00e9ment g\u00e9n\u00e9rique et d\u00e9j\u00e0, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, le concept me s\u00e9duisait. J'avoue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 refroidi et \u00eatre rest\u00e9 perplexe devant la r\u00e9elle complexit\u00e9 du jeu. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venu. L\u00e9gendes, les r\u00e8gles compl\u00e8tes Le jeu me paraissait injouable . Plus tard, je me suis quand m\u00eame procur\u00e9 L\u00e9gendes des 1001 nuits , parce que j'aimais bien l'univers. Le travail sur le background \u00e9tait vraiment s\u00e9rieux mais je ne voyais pas comment je pouvais faire jouer ce jeu, en tous cas, pas avec le moteur de jeu original. Cela revient depuis plusieurs fois dans ce blog, mais \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, peu de gens avaient vraiment le temps ou les comp\u00e9tences d'adapter des suppl\u00e9ments d'un jeu pour un autre.

Je m'en souviens encore... Sans parler de la longueur du processus de cr\u00e9ation des personnages, une fois \u00e0 la table, le bilan fut d\u00e9sastreux : apr\u00e8s 6 heures de jeu, nous n'en sommes toujours qu'au d\u00e9but du sc\u00e9nario. Nous avons principalement jou\u00e9 un combat d'une minute de jeu (60 secondes) en 4h30 ! H\u00e9 oui, le combat seconde par seconde... C'\u00e9tait trop pour moi. En fait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, que ce soit L\u00e9gendes Celtiques ou L\u00e9gendes des 1001 nuits , il faut voir qu'il \u00e9tait compliqu\u00e9 d'int\u00e9resser des joueurs \u00e0 ces univers. Jouer des Gaulois dans un monde avec de la magie \u00e0 la marge , ce n'est pas tr\u00e8s facile. Car, quoiqu'on puisse en penser, les points de rep\u00e8res du joueur des ann\u00e9es 80 dans le monde celtique ne sont pas tr\u00e8s nombreux. La difficult\u00e9 du genre historico-magique # Ce genre \"historico-magique\" est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant intellectuellement, mais tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire jouer et \u00e0 jouer dans les deux dimensions suivantes : Les joueurs n'ont pas forc\u00e9ment la connaissance historique du monde ; Ces derniers n'ont pas non plus la connaissance de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la magie qui est faite par le jeu. Note : Voir la grille d'analyse des moteurs de JDR et l'importance de la magie. Le travail du MJ est d'autant plus complexe. Si j'\u00e9tais cynique, je dirais que ce genre a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"prof d'histoire\" ou \"prof de fran\u00e7ais\". Quand on lit certains de ces jeux, on a l'impression de lire les bouquins de la s\u00e9rie \"La vie quotidienne\". C'est vrai pour le monde des L\u00e9gendes Celtiques , mais aussi pour le monde des 1001 nuits qui, quoique beaucoup plus magique, est au final peu connu. On conna\u00eet Ali Baba, Aladdin, les g\u00e9nies et les tapis volants, mais souvent, cela ne va pas plus loin. Comment pouvoir se projeter (\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque) dans un monde tr\u00e8s religieux gouvern\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sence d'Allah et par une vision musulmane du monde ? Attention, je ne mets pas en cause les auteurs (notamment Jean-Marc Montel ) qui ont vraiment accompli un morceau de bravoure... Mais quid de leur travail ? O\u00f9 est-il ? Nulle part ! Descartes se fait racheter et puis, pouf, le contenu dispara\u00eet dans les limbes ! Il n'est m\u00eame pas publi\u00e9 en PDF comme les vieilles versions de AD&D . Incroyable comme nous, fran\u00e7ais, pouvons g\u00e2cher notre talent ! Mais heureusement que les am\u00e9ricains ne font pas la m\u00eame chose ! Sinon , nous ne jouerions plus \u00e0 AD&D ni \u00e0 CoC ! Pour en revenir \u00e0 l'approche de L\u00e9gendes , les autres jeux de r\u00f4les traitent le sujet diff\u00e9remment. La fantasy s'appuie sur un imaginaire m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique tr\u00e8s mall\u00e9able et tr\u00e8s ouvert, et les jeux d'horreur contemporaine se situent dans des univers proches du n\u00f4tre. De plus, ces deux types de jeux mettent au centre du jeu la d\u00e9couverte : des souterrains (\"dungeons\") pour le premier, et de l'horreur cach\u00e9e pour le second. Les trois dimensions de l'accessibilit\u00e9 du jeu # On pourrait proposer une grille d'analyse des jeux bas\u00e9e sur la capacit\u00e9 des joueurs \u00e0 acc\u00e9der facilement \u00e0 l'univers : Dans sa dimension pragmatique : est-ce que le joueur peut rapidement \"intuiter\" des postures compatibles avec l'univers ? Dans sa dimension magique : est-ce que le joueur peut rapidement intuiter ce qui est faisable par la magie ? Avec ces deux dimensions, nous pourrions d\u00e9finir une grille de lecture de l' accessibilit\u00e9 du monde au joueur, un genre de ticket d'entr\u00e9e pour les joueurs. Je vais rajouter une troisi\u00e8me dimension qui me tient \u00e0 coeur : le pourquoi. Pourquoi jouer dans ce monde ? Pourquoi est-ce int\u00e9ressant ? Quel type de personnages est int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 vivre dans ce monde ? Quelle est la grande motivation des joueurs, de tous les joueurs ? Le jeu historique est vraiment le jeu pour qui cette question est la plus naturelle : certes, la p\u00e9riode r\u00e9volutionnaire est int\u00e9ressante historiquement parlant, mais est-il int\u00e9ressant de jouer des acteurs de cette p\u00e9riode historique quand on n'est ni un prof d'histoire, ni un prof de fran\u00e7ais ? Je vais nommer cette troisi\u00e8me dimension : la motivation fondamentale , sous-entendu, \"pour jouer\". La quatri\u00e8me dimension sera la complexit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de jeu qui est quand m\u00eame un param\u00e8tre important dans l'\u00e9quation. Nous pouvons d\u00e9finir une \u00e9chelle \u00e0 trois valeurs : Facile : 3 points, Moyenne : 2 points, Difficile : 1 point, Tr\u00e8s difficile : 0 points. Ensuite, faisons les calculs et regardons les r\u00e9sultats ! Jeu Access. Monde Access.

Pendragon, premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, 1985 Notons que L\u00e9gendes arrive dans le peloton de queue. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, c'est moi qui note. La double peine ? # Sans vouloir faire de mauvais esprit, jouer \u00e0 L\u00e9gendes , c'est un peu la double peine : Les r\u00e8gles sont hyper-compliqu\u00e9es ; L'univers a une accessibilit\u00e9 faible, voire tr\u00e8s faible, pour les joueurs. Mais pourquoi cumuler les deux difficult\u00e9s ? Cette question m'a souvent turlupin\u00e9. Mettons que je sois cr\u00e9ateur de JDR : je fais un effort sur l'univers, supposons la Gaule. D\u00e9j\u00e0 le jeu ne s'adressera qu'\u00e0 une frange tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8re de joueurs, des joueurs int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par vivre des aventures dans un autre temps, l\u00e9g\u00e8rement teint\u00e9 de magie, une magie qui plus est vue comme optionnelle... Bref, comme je suis tr\u00e8s malin, je vais, en plus, choisir un syst\u00e8me de jeu hyper-complexe et \"simulationniste\" ? Soit c'est de la pr\u00e9tention incroyable, soit de la stupidit\u00e9... Ou alors un peu des deux. Sans doute le probl\u00e8me est-il li\u00e9 au sujet du \"play-testing\". Quand un jeu sort aux US, il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 test\u00e9 et \u00e9prouv\u00e9 par beaucoup de joueurs. D'o\u00f9 les multiples \u00e9ditions du jeu, pour prendre en compte les retours du terrain. D'o\u00f9 un business r\u00e9current de la vente des \u00e9ditions successives (h\u00e9h\u00e9 pas fous les gars). D'o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de suivre la gamme... en ne faisant pas travailler que ses potes... Oui parce que dans notre monde fran\u00e7ais, il faut le reconna\u00eetre, nous sommes quand m\u00eame dans le copinage beaucoup plus que dans la comp\u00e9tence . En France, nous sommes trop forts tout de suite . Nous publions des jeux parfaits qui n'ont pas besoin d'une seconde \u00e9dition ; ou alors 20 ans apr\u00e8s quand les jeunes d'autrefois sont devenus des cadres nostalgiques et lisent les beaux bouquins tr\u00e8s chers de JDR dans leur lit le soir en ayant peur de les ab\u00eemer. M\u00e9ga , avec ses 5 \u00e9ditions, fait figure d'exception et c'est tant mieux. Au moins, ses cr\u00e9ateurs acceptent le retour du terrain et les changements ou pr\u00e9cisions de r\u00e8gles. [Peut-\u00eatre que NeoMega va mettre un coup de pied dans la fourmili\u00e8re du monde p\u00e9p\u00e8re des M\u00e9gas un peu \"fonctionnaires\" sur les bords !] Cons\u00e9quence pour L\u00e9gendes : il faut \u00eatre (tr\u00e8s) motiv\u00e9 en tant que MJ et avoir des joueurs tr\u00e8s motiv\u00e9s pour aller dans cette direction, sachant qu'en plus, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, les ouvrages de la gamme sont tous sauf donn\u00e9s. Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes, le d\u00e9sastre # Poursuivons. La s\u00e9rie Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes commet, selon moi, deux erreurs fondamentales : Elle reprend la marque L\u00e9gendes , qui avait quand m\u00eame une connotation n\u00e9gative de jeu injouable ; Elle ajoute le terme Premi\u00e8res qui produit une r\u00e9elle catastrophe marketing. Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes de la Table Ronde L\u00e0 o\u00f9 D&D propose deux s\u00e9ries, le D&D \"normal\" et un jeu \"advanced\", AD&D pour les joueurs confirm\u00e9s, Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes donne l'impression d'un jeu pour les enfants (alors qu'il est encore hyper-complexe), c'est le marketing AD&D \u00e0 l'envers ! En plus, la couverture est hideuse ! L'effet est donc incroyablement percutant : Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes, c'est comme le jeu hypercomplexe, mais pour les blaireaux (sous-entendu les non r\u00f4listes). Il aurait fallu, je pense : Trouver un autre nom, Trouver un autre syst\u00e8me de jeux, pour rendre plus accessible ces univers... Bon, je sais, ce que je propose ressemble un peu \u00e0 l'approche de GURPS . Ce qui est incompr\u00e9hensible, c'est que Descartes re-signe pour trois produits des plus confus. La Table Ronde sort en 1986, soit un an apr\u00e8s la parution de Pendragon aux Etats-Unis, la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e que la traduction en fran\u00e7ais dudit jeu chez Gallimard (un travail de cochon). Le jeu qui n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec la Table Ronde, aurait d\u00fb s'appeler L\u00e9gendes du Moyen-Age . Il se passe au XIII\u00e8me si\u00e8cle et est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s historique... L\u00e9gendes Celtiques en 1987, rajoute \u00e0 la confusion, en particulier des suppl\u00e9ments : est-ce qu'un uppl\u00e9ment L\u00e9gendes Celtiques est utilisable avec (Premi\u00e8res) L\u00e9gendes Celtiques sachant que le syst\u00e8me de jeu est \"presque\" compatible mais pas compl\u00e8tement ? Mais pourquoi se lancer dans un tel imbroglio ? Parfois, il faut savoir abandonner une marque... L\u00e9gendes de la Vall\u00e9e des Rois en 1988 apporte un peu d'air frais \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie gr\u00e2ce au travail de Christian Caroli . Mais l\u00e0 encore, m\u00eame si le produit est travaill\u00e9, l'accessibilit\u00e9 du jeu est super super faible, tellement que cela signera l'arr\u00eat de mort de la gamme. Encart positif : Si vous voulez jouer en 2022 des chevaliers, jouez \u00e0 Pendragon . Si vous voulez jouer des gaulois, malheureusement, \u00e7a va \u00eatre chaud : regardez sur la sc\u00e8ne des JDR indie des fois que quelqu'un ait eu l'id\u00e9e d'adapter L\u00e9gendes \u00e0 un moteur de jeu jouable ; ou alors Jouez \u00e0 GURPS Celtic Myths. GURPS Celtic Myths Si vous voulez jouer dans le monde des Pharaons, je vous conseille GURPS Egypt. Ou alors quelqu'un devra faire l'effort d'adapter le contenu de M. Caroli \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de jeu moins d\u00e9bile. GURPS Egypt Sur ce dernier jeu, ne nous m\u00e9prenons pas, je pense que la qualit\u00e9 du contenu fran\u00e7ais est meilleure , mais la jouabilit\u00e9 est bien moindre. Donc, il faut faire un choix : Soit ceux qui poss\u00e8dent les droits de L\u00e9gendes de la Vall\u00e9e des Rois font un reboot avec le m\u00eame contenu \u00e9dit\u00e9 autrement, par quelqu'un d'autre, et pour un autre syst\u00e8me de jeu, jouable, celui-l\u00e0 (et pourquoi pas pour plusieurs... oulala, c'est chaud !), sachant que les joueurs d'aujourd'hui sont encore moins sensibles \u00e0 l'univers ; Soit le travail peut rester dans les limbes, et on joue \u00e0 autre chose ou alors on joue \u00e0 GURPS en anglais. Moi, j'ai un travail full time, donc sur ce coup-ci, ce n'est pas moi qui vous aiderait. Blague \u00e0 part. La gamme L\u00e9gendes va souffrir du syndrome fran\u00e7ais : pas de suivi, pas de \"service apr\u00e8s-vente\" (SAV). En fait, c'est tout le contraire chez les am\u00e9ricains - alors que souvent, le jeu est l'oeuvre d'une seule personne (au moins au d\u00e9but) : Des jeux play-test\u00e9s, Une accessibilit\u00e9 travaill\u00e9e, et retravaill\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque \u00e9dition (aussi parce que les joueurs changent, et donc les demandes du \"march\u00e9\" changent), Un suivi avec des suppl\u00e9ments, ce qui veut dire que les gens croient au jeu et que le jeu a une vraie \"part de march\u00e9\" (oulala le gros mot en France, berk !). Bref # Je suis peut-\u00eatre n\u00e9gatif mais nous avons l\u00e0 l'exemple type de la pr\u00e9tention fran\u00e7aise : Des jeux tr\u00e8s complexes, Dans des univers difficiles d'acc\u00e8s pour les joueurs, Aucun suivi (les fran\u00e7ais n'aiment pas le support apr\u00e8s-vente), Un marketing tr\u00e8s nase, Et surtout... une bonne grosse dose de pr\u00e9tention de faire mieux que les ricains, parce que, attention, nous on est cultiv\u00e9s et on sait jouer dans des mondes historiques de profs d'histoire (avec un peu de magie, mais pas trop quand m\u00eame sinon, c'est trop de la superstition, \u00e7a fait pas assez rationnel et cultiv\u00e9), Une compr\u00e9hension faible des r\u00e8gles de base du business (faire plaisir \u00e0 ses clients et non \u00e0 ses copains). Parfois, je trouve que nous, les fran\u00e7ais, sommes vraiment des gros lourds pr\u00e9tentieux, des id\u00e9ologues. Pas \u00e9tonnant que nous soyons d\u00e9test\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger. Et que nous jouions \u00e0 des jeux am\u00e9ricains... 25 septembre 2022 A la recherche du meilleur syst\u00e8me (simple) de JDR (2) # J'ai un peu modifi\u00e9 mon programme de stats de combats pour qu'il prenne en compte les modificateurs de type 2d6+2 ou 1d10-1 . Mon but \u00e9tait de v\u00e9rifier que le syst\u00e8me d6 est bien moins avantageux pour celui qui qui a un modificateur plus faible qu'un syst\u00e8me lin\u00e9aire d12 . Vous me direz, c'est \u00e9vident. En fait oui. Prenons le cas d'un combat avec AFF et donc un combat avec COMP+2d6+Talent contre un monstre ayant COMP+2d6 . Il s'agit donc de comparer les courbes de deux entit\u00e9s ayant 2d6+A et 2d6+B et de les comparer avec le cas o\u00f9 l'on utiliserait un d12 . Joueur 1 Joueur 2 Proba Jet 1 > Jet 2 Proba Jet 1 \u2264 Jet 2 2d6 2d6+4 10% 90% 1d12 1d12+4 19% 81% Soit pr\u00e8s de deux fois plus de chances de r\u00e9ussir dans le cas du d12 . Dans le cas d'une victoire ou \u00e9galit\u00e9 : Joueur 1 Joueur 2 Proba Jet 1 \u2265 Jet 2 Proba Jet 1 < Jet 2 2d6 2d6+4 16% 84% 1d12 1d12+4 25% 75% C'est compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rent. Je ne vais pas me paraphraser quand \u00e0 l' analyse des jeux D6 mais on comprend pourquoi les syst\u00e8mes d20 ou d100 se sont impos\u00e9s : parce qu'ils sont plus fair play et n'offre pas les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de d\u00e9formation des coubes \u00e0 nd6 . Notons que m\u00eame pour les jets sous la COMP+Talent ou la COMP+Magie , et m\u00eame si le score total est de 11 ou plus, 12 \u00e9tant toujours un \u00e9chec, il reste une chance sur douze ( 8% ) d'\u00e9chouer. Alors que le pourcentage de chances de faire un double 6 sur 2d6 est de 1/36 soit \u00e0 peine 3% . Froika! risque donc d'\u00eatre un syst\u00e8me d12 qui sera donc compatible avec Troika! et AFF mais en plus lin\u00e9aire. Il reste juste \u00e0 limiter la COMP \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du perso. Je trouve 6+1d6 trop permissif, 3+1d3 trop punitif, il reste 6+1d4 ou 6+1d3 . A voir. 19 septembre 2022 A la recherche du meilleur syst\u00e8me (simple) de JDR (1) # Gestion des tests simples # Les tests simples sont utilis\u00e9s pour les tests de comp\u00e9tences. Il faut tester le PJ pour savoir s'il r\u00e9ussit ou pas. Selon les jeux, la comp\u00e9tence test\u00e9e (parfois appel\u00e9e caract\u00e9ristique, talent, ou autre) est soit une constante (par exemple 45% ou 12 ), soit quelque chose de variable (par exemple 4d6 ou 1d8 ). Le test peut prendre deux une des deux grandes formes suivantes : Si la comp\u00e9tence est une constante , le jet de d\u00e9s permet de se mesurer \u00e0 elle : il faut faire soit inf\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence (courant), soit sup\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal (plus rare). Si la comp\u00e9tence est une variable , le MJ doit d\u00e9terminer un facteur de difficult\u00e9 : le jet devra donc battre ce facteur, souvent sup\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal \u00e0 ce dernier. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les syst\u00e8mes de JDR g\u00e8rent ce cas sans probl\u00e8me notable. Il faut juste s'assurer que les statistiques ne soient pas tordues (voir l'article sur les syst\u00e8mes D6 ). Il faut noter une diff\u00e9rence importante sur les tests \u00e0 base de comp\u00e9tence : le test de la comp\u00e9tence constante n'oblige pas le MJ \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer un facteur de difficult\u00e9 dans la plupart des cas. Des bonus et malus peuvent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s dans des cas exceptionnels mais le joueur conna\u00eet sa chance de r\u00e9ussite de base dans tous les cas. Par exemple, sur un syst\u00e8me en pourcentage, si je poss\u00e8de 60% dans une comp\u00e9tence, je comprend imm\u00e9diatement mes chances de r\u00e9ussite, le d100 \u00e9tant, de plus, une distribution statistique lin\u00e9aire (ce qui n'est pas le cas de 3d6 par exemple). Les syst\u00e8mes \u00e0 seuil de difficult\u00e9 ont le d\u00e9savantage de faire appel au MJ pour toutes les situations, ce qui, \u00e0 la longue, peut entra\u00eener un sentiment d'arbitraire chez les joueurs. J'avoue que personnellement, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re les jets contre des scores de comp\u00e9tences fixes. Comme j'\u00e9vite les bonus/malus, sauf cas exceptionnel ou sc\u00e8ne cruciale, le jeu va plus vite. Les deux grands probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre # En fait, \u00e0 mon avis, les deux grands probl\u00e8mes de conception d'un syst\u00e8me de JDR sont les suivants : \u00c9quilibrer les combats (m\u00eal\u00e9e et \u00e0 distance entre les joueurs et les adversaires), \u00c9quilibrer la magie (ou les pouvoirs psy), \u00e0 la fois entre les joueurs (pour un certain \u00e9quilibre du groupe) et avec les adversaires. Certains jeux comme Call Of Cthulhu simplifient un peu le probl\u00e8me en d\u00e9clarant que la magie est finalement r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux adversaires (fous). Certes, un PJ peut conna\u00eetre un sort, mais pas au sens D&D . D'autres jeux comme D&D deviennent int\u00e9ressants d\u00e8s lors que tous les PJs sont d'un niveau suffisant, et donc que les PJs ayant des sorts peuvent les utiliser. Dans les premiers niveaux, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9. Et, \u00e0 plus haut niveau, l'\u00e9quilibre redevient compliqu\u00e9 (et n'est pas le m\u00eame suivant les \u00e9ditions). D'autres jeux comme Ars Magica pr\u00e9viennent d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but que le magicien sera le plus fort et de loin (et donc les PJs ne sont pas \u00e9quilibr\u00e9s). Dans les nouveaux moteurs de jeux simplifi\u00e9s ( FU , Black Hack et consorts), je reste sur ma faim car cette \u00e9quation est finalement souvent mal r\u00e9solue. En fait, je cherche depuis longtemps un moteur de jeux simplifi\u00e9 g\u00e9rant correctement la magie et les combats avec des m\u00e9canismes simples et extensibles. La fa\u00e7on de Dungeoneer de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me # Dans ma recherche, apr\u00e8s avoir traduit et compress\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles de Fighting Fantasy (disponible ici ou sur itch.io , j'ai r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 une copie d' Advanced Fighting Fantasy - Dungeoneer , une extension du jeu de Steve Jackson et de Ian Livingstone. Advanced Fighting Fantasy - Dungeoneer L'extension concerne deux dimensions : Des talents (comp\u00e9tences avanc\u00e9es ou advanced skills ), Un syst\u00e8me de magie. Les talents fonctionnent comme des bonus, par exemple un talent de combat \u00e0 l'\u00e9p\u00e9e de 2 donnera un bonus de 2 lors du combat contre l'adversaire. Ainsi, le joueur tirera COMP+2D6+2 contre un adversaire. Le joueur a COMP points \u00e0 r\u00e9partir dans ses talents. La syst\u00e8me de magie est assez malin et en deux temps : A la cr\u00e9ation du PJ, le joueur doit choisir de combien de points il ampute sa COMP pour cr\u00e9er son score de magie (pris sur les points de comp\u00e9tences avanc\u00e9es). Supposons que j'ai tir\u00e9 1d6+6 pour ma COMP et que j'obtienne 10 . Je d\u00e9cide d'affecter 4 points \u00e0 la magie. J'aurais donc COMP=6 et Magie (4) . Pour r\u00e9ussir un sort, je devrai donc faire un jet sous ma COMP+Magie , ce qui est ma COMP initiale. Suivant la difficult\u00e9 du sort, je perdrai un certain nombre de PdV . Cela signifie aussi que pour toutes mes autres comp\u00e9tences non magiques, ma COMP restera \u00e0 6 et donc j'aurai moins de chances de r\u00e9ussite structurellement . Le nombre de points restant pour les autres talents est de COMP-Magie= 10-4=6 ce qui \u00e9quilibre la magie avec les autres comp\u00e9tences. \u00c9videmment, dans ce syst\u00e8me, on peut se poser la question si faire un jet de 2d6 sous la COMP+Comp\u00e9tence avanc\u00e9e n'est pas un peu facile. Il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans le jeu qu'un 12 est toujours un \u00e9chec, mais effectivement, on retrouve l'aspect un peu \"facile\" de Fighting Fantasy original. La fa\u00e7on Troika! # Troika! prend une approche encore plus simple sur deux dimensions : La COMP est tir\u00e9e avec 1d3+3 seulement, ce qui rend les jets sous la COMP+Comp\u00e9tence avanc\u00e9e (beaucoup) plus difficiles (trop sans doute) ; La connaissance d'un sort est un talent comme un autre (m\u00eame si l'utilisation des sorts fait perdre des points de vie). Il y a certains avantages \u00e0 ce syst\u00e8me : Il est encore plus simple que celui de Dungeoneer ; Il permet \u00e0 tous les arch\u00e9types de personnage d'avoir des talents dont des sorts, sans distinction ; Il est bas\u00e9 sur un syst\u00e8me de points de comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 r\u00e9partir qui ne d\u00e9pend pas de la COMP et donc, qui ne poss\u00e8de cet effet \"double-peine\" qui est qu'une COMP faible implique une restriction sur les talents \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du personnage (comme dans Dungeoneer ). Les r\u00e8gles proposent de cr\u00e9er des arch\u00e9types \u00e0 partir de 10 points de talents, m\u00eame si, dans le livre de base, certains arch\u00e9types sont cr\u00e9\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de 13 voire 14 points de talents. Une grille d'analyse hyper-simple des moteurs de JDR # Cela fait donc une grille d'analyse \u00e0 trois dimensions tr\u00e8s simple : Dimension Enjeu Difficult\u00e9 de conception Tests simples Ne pas faire intervenir le MJ pour des facteurs de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque action Moyen \u00c9quilibre des combats Entre un PJ et un adversaire (combat en m\u00eal\u00e9e et \u00e0 distance) Facile \u00c9quilibre de la magie/pouvoirs psy Dans la dimension, \u00e9quilibre des PJs ensemble, et contre les adversaires Difficile Table 1 : Grille d'analyse des moteurs de JDR Application \u00e0 quelques jeux # Prenons les notes possibles suivantes : A : tr\u00e8s bien pris en charge ; B : moyennement pris en charge ; C : mal pris en charge ; I : inapplicable, le jeu a \u00e9vit\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me.

(en fait plut\u00f4t AFF ) et j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas mal de mat\u00e9riel. 18 septembre 2022 NeoMega pour Froika! # Bon, la r\u00e9flexion avance. D\u00e8s que j'ai fini la traduction de Troika! (nom actuel Froika! ), je me lance dans l'adaptation \u00e0 M\u00e9ga . M\u00eame si j'aime beaucoup l'univers et le travail remarquable fait dans le cadre de l' Encyclop\u00e9die Galactique , je trouve que de nombreux points n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exploit\u00e9s. Tout d'abord, la timeline d\u00e9crite dans M\u00e9ga 3 et \u00e9toff\u00e9e dans M\u00e9ga 4 reste \u00e9vasive et des d\u00e9tails manquent quant \u00e0 l' Eclipse des Soleils et les fameuses Choses du Vide . Ensuite, le fait de pouvoir transiter est d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelque chose de potentiellement d\u00e9stabilisant pour une nation galactique (possibilit\u00e9 de vois des arm\u00e9es d\u00e9barquer par des t\u00e9tra\u00e8dres), mais le fait de pouvoir se transf\u00e9rer dans quelqu'un d'autre pose un probl\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 galactique . Il est donc obligatoire que certains \u00e9tats aient, \u00e0 un moment, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la Guilde comme une menace \u00e0 \u00e9liminer. Ou alors, il \u00e9tait obligatoire que certains ren\u00e9gats aient une envie folle de prendre le contr\u00f4le de royaumes ou de l'AG. Je me souviens des livres de Philip Dick : quand un monde est empli de gens ayant des pouvoirs psy, toute la \"texture\" du monde est diff\u00e9rente. Je pense que les potentialit\u00e9s de M\u00e9ga n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exploit\u00e9es compl\u00e8tement. On en est rest\u00e9 \u00e0 un monde un peu bisounours o\u00f9 les M\u00e9gas se baladent comme ils veulent avec des pouvoirs capables de changer le cours de l'histoire (le sujet est en filigrane dans M\u00e9ga 2). C'est pourquoi, je vais travailler en ce sens, un genre de r\u00e9interpr\u00e9tation de l'univers. Possible que \u00e7a ne donne pas grand chose, mais on sait jamais. 04 septembre 2022 Langue de pute # J'ai donc fait une synth\u00e8se des sc\u00e9narios des vieux Casus (premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie) pour retrouver principalement tout ce qui concernant Cthulhu et M\u00e9ga . J'ai aussi concat\u00e9n\u00e9 tout ce que je trouvais sur Laelith , premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, y compris les sc\u00e9narios D&D de Denis Beck (avant la parution du Laelith 2e dans le format \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re du Casus deuxi\u00e8me formule, sachant qu'on est maintenant \u00e0 Laelith 3e , des tr\u00e8s beaux livres de collection pour les quadra/quinca nostalgiques mais ayant des sous). J'ai (re)d\u00e9couvert pas mal de choses : L'ind\u00e9cision totale du journal et son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre un sujet tr\u00e8s longtemps. L'incompr\u00e9hensible soutien \u00e0 Simulacres , ce jeu compl\u00e8tement merdique, malgr\u00e9 les efforts d\u00e9mentiels de son auteur pour l'imposer de force et en mettre de partout, alors qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, les syst\u00e8mes D&D et AdC \u00e9taient les plus pratiqu\u00e9s. Au lieu de faire des pages et des pages pour Simulacres , pourquoi ne pas traduire les sc\u00e9narios pour les diff\u00e9rents syst\u00e8mes de jeux ? Avec le recul, on voit que l'Heroic Fantasy \u00e0 la D&D ou l'horreur lovecraftienne \u00e0 la Call Of Cthulhu passent par tous les syst\u00e8mes... L'incompr\u00e9hensible sp\u00e9cialisation des sc\u00e9narios \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de jeu. Par exemple, tout sc\u00e9nario D&D aurait pu avoir sa traduction pour Runequest ou Warhammer . Je crois avoir vu cela dans un seul num\u00e9ro de Casus. Et comment font les joueurs ? Ils font la traduction seuls ? Ils sont suppos\u00e9s conna\u00eetre tous les jeux et poss\u00e9der tous les suppl\u00e9ments ? H\u00e9 non, ils sont suppos\u00e9s les jouer avec Simulacres ! L'hyperfocalisation sur Shadowrun qui n'est tout de m\u00eame pas le jeu du si\u00e8cle. Des sc\u00e9narios sur des jeux de troisi\u00e8me zone, hyper-sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, impossibles \u00e0 trouver en boutique \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et tellement sp\u00e9cifiques qu'ils en \u00e9taient impossibles \u00e0 adapter. Un soutien absolu \u00e0 R\u00eave de Dragon que, franchement, personne ne jouait autour de moi. Bon, OK, Denis Gerfaud est sympa, mais quand m\u00eame. Je m'\u00e9tais toujours demand\u00e9 pourquoi Pendragon n'avait pas perc\u00e9 en France, mais c'\u00e9tait parce que tout le monde voulait faire la promo des L\u00e9gendes de la Table Ronde qui, vu de moi, fut un bide complet (la traduction nase de Gallimard en 1986 n'a pas aid\u00e9). Dans les Casus premi\u00e8re version, \u00e0 un certain moment, on en arrive un moment au comble : l'auteure du jeu LDLTR (Anne V\u00e9tillard) \u00e9crivant des sc\u00e9narios pour Pendragon ! On cro\u00eet r\u00eaver ! Pourquoi avoir gard\u00e9 des pages sur les wargames ? Il y avait des lecteurs ? Et la pub... Mon dieu, tant de pubs... Au final, quand on se tape tous les Casus premi\u00e8re mouture, on comprend comment, petit \u00e0 petit, le public a fui. Sur certains num\u00e9ros, il n'y a rien \u00e0 garder, m\u00eame du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des sc\u00e9narios. Enfin, il reste certains sc\u00e9narios pas mal, mais ils sont souvent des m\u00eames auteurs (notamment Denis Beck et Tristan Lhomme, j'aime bien aussi Jean Balczesak)... Tempus fugit . 28 ao\u00fbt 2022 Un \u00e9t\u00e9 tranquille # Bon, pas mal de choses : Je poursuis la traduction de Troika! avec une approche un peu personnelle des illustrations. Mais c'est lent. J'ai pas mal travaill\u00e9 sur la comparaison entre les syst\u00e8mes de jeu de Fighting Fantasy , celui de Advanced Fighting Fantasy 1e , et celui de Troika! . Ce n'est pas encore pr\u00eat mais c'est assez int\u00e9ressant. En parall\u00e8le, je travaille sur l'adaptation du syst\u00e8me AFF \u00e0 M\u00e9ga , pour avoir quelque chose plus \u00e9labor\u00e9 que \u00e7a mais quand m\u00eame hyper-simple. J'ai d\u00e9couvert Ars Magica pendant les vacances notamment avec la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9dition de 1989 de Lion Rampant (avant les versions White Wolf ). J'avoue que ce jeu est assez fascinant, un peu dans le genre du jeu de r\u00f4le que j'aurais toujours voulu jouer au Moyen-\u00e2ge. J'y reviendrai. J'ai trouv\u00e9 une bonne occase de D&D 4e DMG sur eBay. Je suis content. Je me suis fait une compil des sc\u00e9narios pour M\u00e9ga des vieux Casus. Je pense \u00e0 la faire imprimer par Lulu. J'ai fait pareil pour les sc\u00e9nars Cthulhu . J'ai travaill\u00e9 sur une page de Links en anglais qui vient d'un refresh de cette page . Au fait, D&D 6e est en route ! \u00c7a se passe ici : https://www.dndbeyond.com/one-dnd . Excitant, non ? 27 ao\u00fbt 2022 Fighting Fantasy (1984) en deux pages # Fighting Fantasy est le syst\u00e8me de jeu des Livres dont vous \u00eates le h\u00e9ros . En 1984, Steve Jackson et Ian Livingstone transforment le syst\u00e8me de jeu des livres solo en JDR tr\u00e8s simple. M\u00eame si le jeu ne contient pas de syst\u00e8me de magie, il est int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 plus d'un titre car il poss\u00e8de une ossature tr\u00e8s saine qui fera qu'il ne ne cessera d'\u00eatre repris, par exemple par Troika! Caract\u00e9ristique Commentaire Skill (1d6+6) Permet la comparaison avec un seuil (2d6 \u2264 Skill) Permet le combat en opposition (comparaison de Skill + 2d6 + modificateurs chez les deux combattants) Permet l'application de bonus et de malus (avec des probabilit\u00e9s lin\u00e9aires) en fonction des armes, ou des conditions Permet l'utilisation de \"comp\u00e9tences avanc\u00e9es\" (genre de bonus permanents au Skill) (*) Stamina (2d6+12) La notion de points de vie rend moins vague l'\u00e9tat des blessures du personnages Cette notion permet une magie bas\u00e9e sur la consommation de Stamina (*) Luck (1d6+6) Cette notion permet de sauver les h\u00e9ros en cas de probl\u00e8me, tout en ne donnant pas un ch\u00e8que en blanc (*) Extensions que l'on trouve \u00e0 la fois dans Advanced Fighting Fantasy de 1989 et dans Troika! . En gros, le jeu est tr\u00e8s sain dans sa structure et d'une simplicit\u00e9 telle qu'on peut jouer avec des enfants tr\u00e8s rapidement. A consommer sans mod\u00e9ration : la version fran\u00e7aise sur le site : T\u00e9l\u00e9charger FightingFantasy-VersionFrancaise-OreyJdr13.pdf Et aussi sur Itch.io : https://rouboudou.itch.io/fighting-fantasy 30 juillet 2022 Ahahahah ! (rire sardonique) # La Poste a livr\u00e9 une journ\u00e9e en avance mes commandes Lulu . Encore une fois, je suis surpris de la qualit\u00e9 de ces impressions. World Without Number # Le premier bouquin re\u00e7u est l'impression de la version gratuite de Worlds Without Number de Kevin Crawford. La couverture est cartonn\u00e9e souple et l'int\u00e9rieur est en couleurs. Moins de 15\u20ac en impression chez Lulu, c'est incroyable. D&D 4e Player's Handbook # Le second bouquin \u00e9tait une tentative : le Players's Handbook de D&D 4\u00e8me \u00e9dition . A partir du PDF, je me suis recompos\u00e9 une couverture cartonn\u00e9e dure avec les mod\u00e8les de Lulu. Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas, Lulu cr\u00e9e un PDF pour la couverture avec juste la bonne \u00e9paisseur sur la tranche selon le nombre de pages et les options prises pour le papier. Le r\u00e9sultat est impeccable. Le livre fait un peu plus de 18\u20ac, tout en couleurs... En fait, j'aurais bien voulu acheter un reprint sur DriveThru ou DmsGuild , mais les livres de r\u00e8gles de la quatri\u00e8me \u00e9dition ne sont plus \u00e9dit\u00e9s. J'ai cherch\u00e9 un peu une occase mais bizarrement, je n'ai rien trouv\u00e9 d'int\u00e9ressant. Je vais pouvoir, avec 14 ans de retard, juger de cette \u00e9dition qui fit couler beaucoup d'encre dans le monde du JDR. C'est mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 arch\u00e9ologue. Autres \u00e9ditions de D&D # En fait, je n'ai jamais jou\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 AD&D 1e , avec une esp\u00e8ce de fascination effray\u00e9e pour le Dungeon Master's Guide, de Gary Gygax, \u00e9norme et \u00e9crit tout petit. Mon MJ de l'\u00e9poque me disait que tout y \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu. Il y avait un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"club d'initi\u00e9s\" chez les MJs de cette \u00e9poque. D'abord, il fallait sacr\u00e9ment bien parler l'anglais, je m'en rends compte aujourd'hui, car Gary \u00e9crit plut\u00f4t pas mal. Ensuite, il fallait passer des semaines \u00e0 lire et dig\u00e9rer tout ce mat\u00e9riel. Avec le recul, je me dis que pas mal de MJs devaient adapter un peu les r\u00e8gles \u00e0 leur sauce, car ne serait-ce que l'anglais de certains d'entre eux \u00e9tait quand m\u00eame approximatif. Pour les gens qui seraient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, j'ai r\u00e9uni dans un repo git quelques articles dudit Gary \u00e9crits dans des vieux Dragon. C'est ici : github.com/orey/DandD Comme je n'ai jamais beaucoup jou\u00e9 \u00e0 D&D , je n'avais quasiment rien en stock, \u00e0 part la bo\u00eete de base de D&D en fran\u00e7ais de 1982 de Moldvay, que j'ai donn\u00e9e \u00e0 mon fr\u00e8re je crois. Donc, il y a deux ans, je n'avais rien. En me remettant un peu dans le coup, j'ai d\u00e9couvert la vague OSR et la fameuse version D&D 3e et 3.5e. En cherchant un peu, j'ai trouv\u00e9 les 3 bouquins d'occase. Le jeu est quand m\u00eame bien touffu. Puis j'ai repris les investigations sur D&D : d'abord sur D&D 0e , puis sur AD&D 1e o\u00f9 j'ai profit\u00e9 d'une promotion sur DmsGuild pour acheter les 3 bouquins en reprint. En plus de l'\u00e9dition 3.5, j'ai lu l'\u00e9dition gratuite de D&D 5e Basic Rules que j'ai fait imprimer chez Lulu (premi\u00e8re tentative, pas top au niveau rendu). Voil\u00e0. Pour l'instant, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition d' AD&D reste ma favorite, m\u00eame si le Manuel du Ma\u00eetre est quand m\u00eame un peu en mode bazar. J'avoue que j'aime bien la logique didactique de Gary Gygax, ainsi que certains parti-pris qu'il avait sur le JDR. Pour la 4e, c'est vraiment une tentative. Il va me falloir un certain temps pour lire le livre et me faire une id\u00e9e. Surtout que j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 Worlds Without Number \u00e0 lire avant... 24 juillet 2022 Worlds Without Number (WWN) # J'avoue que je ne suis pas facilement impressionn\u00e9 par les JDR actuels. J'ai, par exemple, dans le contexte Ennies 2022, pass\u00e9 un peu de temps sur la synth\u00e8se Level 1 de 9thlevel 2021 et m\u00eame 2020 et l\u00e0, pour moi, on est dans un autre monde... loin de DCC et du JDR tel que je le connais. Par exemple, Colostle , qui semble faire son petit effet dans la sph\u00e8re des Ennies 2022, est un jeu sympa, plut\u00f4t pour ados, et son utilisation des cartes (jeu de 54 cartes) \u00e0 la place des d\u00e9s est une id\u00e9e sympathique, qui n'est pas sans rappeler celle de Fortune Wheels qui est aussi un jeu anglais. C\u00f4t\u00e9 probabilit\u00e9s, cela innove un peu : dans un jeu complet, on a une chance sur 13 de tirer une carte, mais si le jeu \u00e9carte les cartes d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9es, cela modifie les probabilit\u00e9s... Bref, venons-en \u00e0 WWN. J'avais lu quelques trucs sur ce jeu, en fait plut\u00f4t sur Stars Without Numbers . Je t\u00e9l\u00e9charge et je tourne les pages. D\u00e9j\u00e0, le volume du livre me semble inhabituel (352 pages). C'est de l'OSR mais avec pas mal de choses int\u00e9ressantes. Puis en page 94, le monde commence \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9crit, puis viennent 200 pages environ de tables pour cr\u00e9er sa campagne, son aventure, etc. Ouahou, quel gigantesque travail. R\u00e9sultat, je me fais une commande de version gratuite sur Lulu et cette derni\u00e8re doit arriver demain. Je pense que je vais l'emporter en vacances car c'est une somme impressionnante qui m\u00e9rite un peu d'attention. Voir : Worlds Without Numbers Free Edition Au fait, les votes pour les Ennies 2022 se terminent ce soir ! A quand des Ennies fran\u00e7ais ? 24 juillet 2022 Fighting Fantasy 1984 en fran\u00e7ais # Fighting Fantasy (FF), le moteur des Livres dont vous \u00cates le H\u00e9ros # Fighting Fantasy est une s\u00e9rie de livres de jeux de r\u00f4les pour un seul joueur cr\u00e9\u00e9e par Steve Jackson (le Steve Jackson anglais et non celui de GURPS qui est am\u00e9ricain) et Ian Livingstone . Le premier volume de la s\u00e9rie fut publi\u00e9 en livre de poche par Pufin en 1982. Cette s\u00e9rie propose un syst\u00e8me de jeu de r\u00f4les tr\u00e8s simple qui fut ensuite compl\u00e9t\u00e9 de diverses fa\u00e7ons, notamment dans le livre Dungeoneer, Advanced Fighting Fantasy , publi\u00e9 en 1989. R\u00e9cemment, le syst\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 repris et customis\u00e9 dans le jeu de r\u00f4les Troika! . Une modeste synth\u00e8se des r\u00e8gles en deux pages # Le document de deux pages que je viens de terminer reprend les r\u00e8gles originales de 1984. J'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 un draft en stock mais je n'\u00e9tais pas totalement satisfait de la pr\u00e9sentation (manque de temps pour finaliser les choses). Comme je voudrais poster cette synth\u00e8se de deux pages du FF de 1984 sur itch.io , j'ai demand\u00e9 sur le site de FF les conditions de le licence. Je vais voir ce qu'ils r\u00e9pondent. La version de 1984 est super l\u00e9g\u00e8re : Elle ne poss\u00e8de pas le syst\u00e8me de comp\u00e9tences avanc\u00e9es que l'on trouve dans Dungeoneer , Elle ne comprend pas de syst\u00e8me de magie. Le contexte Troika! # Je suis en train de traduire Troika! depuis le SRD en mettant en illustration une toile de ma\u00eetre quand je le peux. Cela donne une certaine \"couleur\" au jeu. Comme le syst\u00e8me de jeu de Troika! est celui de Advanced Fighting Fantasy , l\u00e9g\u00e8rement adapt\u00e9 (sur la COMP notamment), j'ai voulu remettre en forme ma version de synth\u00e8se des r\u00e8gles de FF 1984 pour comprendre un peu la g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie du truc. A noter que FF et Troika! sont deux produits anglais, et qu'il est impossible \u00e0 tout r\u00f4liste anglais de ma g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de ne pas conna\u00eetre FF . En fait, ce qui me botte dans ce syst\u00e8me, c'est son accessibilit\u00e9, et notamment la capacit\u00e9 de jouer avec des ados en quelques minutes. Comme avec Ghostbusters , le syst\u00e8me se ma\u00eetrise en un rien de temps. Reboot de Advanced Fighting Fantasy # A ce propos, Advanced Fighting Fantasy a \u00e9t\u00e9 reboot\u00e9 par Arion Games. Ils en sont m\u00eame \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9dition. Par contre, le graphisme int\u00e9rieur ne m'a pas totalement s\u00e9duit. Il y a tant d'artistes de talent dans le monde de la fantasy que c'est dommage de faire une mise en page comme je la fais si on a quelques moyens. 24 juillet 2022 News # Voil\u00e0 les sujets qui m'ont occup\u00e9 ces derniers temps : Je poursuis la traduction de Troika! C'est un gros travail surtout dans un contexte de manque structurel de temps. Elle sera sans doute gratuite. Vu sur itch.io , le suppl\u00e9ment Fangenoire pour P\u00e9rilleuses Contr\u00e9es, par OSR-VF . Un gros travail de super qualit\u00e9 ! J'ai achet\u00e9 et lu le jeu Colostle mais je n'ai pas eu le temps de tester. L'univers est amusant mais cela ressemble quand m\u00eame \u00e0 un jeu pour enfants. J'ai vot\u00e9 pour les Ennies 2022 et ce fut un gros travail. Quelques trucs int\u00e9ressants dans la sc\u00e8ne TTRPG alternative mais il faudrait que j'ai plus de temps. Rien que de voter s\u00e9rieusement m'a pris plusieurs heures en plusieurs jours. Vous avez jusqu'au 24 juillet 2022 pour voter : https://vote.ennie-awards.com/vote/2022/ J'ai eu The Witcher TTRPG comme cadeau d'anniversaire mais je n'ai pas encore d\u00e9marr\u00e9 la lecture. Il faut que j'int\u00e8gre le facteur de chaos au eGME (voir plus bas). 23 juillet 2022 A propos de la premi\u00e8re version du \"eGME\" en ligne # La version du GME (beta) fait appel \u00e0 quelques concepts de Mythic que je trouve bien. Je vais le nommer \"eGME\" pour le distinguer du GME Mythic notamment (et puis c'est moins long \u00e0 \u00e9crire). Concept 1 : les sc\u00e8nes et leur structure # Le jeu solo est un ensemble de sc\u00e8nes. Ces sc\u00e8nes font appara\u00eetre des PNJ et des pistes (des intrigues). Figure 1 : vue de la structure des sc\u00e8nes du eGME Concept 2 : la sc\u00e8ne a trois \u00e9tats # La sc\u00e8ne poss\u00e8de 3 \u00e9tats diff\u00e9rents : Au d\u00e9but, on d\u00e9crit comme elle commence, elle est \"normale\" ; Elle peut \u00eatre \"alt\u00e9r\u00e9e\", soit modifi\u00e9e suite \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ; Elle peut \u00eatre \"interrompue\", ce qui signifie qu'autre chose se passe (pilot\u00e9 par un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire Concept 3 : le facteur de chaos # Dans Mythic et ses extensions, il existe plusieurs fa\u00e7ons, en d\u00e9but de sc\u00e8ne, de savoir si cette derni\u00e8re subit une modification. Dans le Mythic GME, c'est le facteur de chaos qui pilote ce param\u00e8tre. Figure 2 : vue de la table du destin de Mythic Le principe du facteur de chaos est que, en fin de sc\u00e8ne, suivant ce que le PJ a ma\u00eetris\u00e9 ou pas, le facteur de chaos diminue ou augmente. Plus le facteur de chaos est grand, plus le risque d'avoir un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire est important. Le facteur de chaos est test\u00e9 en d\u00e9but de sc\u00e8ne. Il d\u00e9cide si une sc\u00e8ne doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e ou pas. Ce concept est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant car il rend le GME \u00e0 la fois plus incertain et pilot\u00e9 par un genre de contexte ext\u00e9rieur de ma\u00eetrise du PJ. Pour l'instant, le facteur de chaos n'est pas impl\u00e9ment\u00e9 dans le GME et la raison est expliqu\u00e9e ci-dessous. Concept 4 : le facteur de chaos comme perturbateur des r\u00e9ponses de l'oracle # Figure 3 : l'oracle dans le eGME L'oracle de Mythic est bas\u00e9 sur une estimation de la probabilit\u00e9 d'occurrence d'un certain \u00e9v\u00e9nement. En fonction de cette probabilit\u00e9, le jet de 1d100 aura plus ou moins de chances de faire dire \"oui\" \u00e0 l'oracle. L'id\u00e9e de Mythic GME est que le facteur de chaos devrait intervenir comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment perturbateur dans les r\u00e9ponses de l'oracle. Cela donne la table du destin en figure 2. Le parti pris par Tana Pigeon, cr\u00e9atrice de Mythic, est d'augmenter les chances pour l'oracle de r\u00e9pondre oui \u00e0 la question quand le facteur de chaos est \u00e9lev\u00e9. Cette option est au final, assez inadapt\u00e9e, car, durant toute la sc\u00e8ne, l'oracle aura une fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre homog\u00e8ne mais distordue. De plus, il est alors facile de lui poser des questions auxquelles le joueur voudrait qu'il r\u00e9ponde oui. J'ai impl\u00e9ment\u00e9 cette version de l'oracle ici , mais elle n'est pas utilis\u00e9e dans le eGME. Tana Pigeon, consciente du probl\u00e8me, a propos\u00e9 dans Mythic Variations 2 une autre fa\u00e7on d'int\u00e9grer l'impact du chaos dans l'oracle. J'avoue que cette solution est plus maligne car elle plus al\u00e9atoire. Elle est aussi impl\u00e9ment\u00e9e l\u00e0 . Mais elle n'est pas utilis\u00e9e dans le eGME. En fait, je ne suis pas satisfait de ce game design. Apr\u00e8s une analyse qu'on pourra trouver ici , je me suis mis \u00e0 tester en mode papier une autre version de cette int\u00e9gration. Concept 4 : l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire # Mythic et Mythic Variation 1 offre diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire. Figure 4 : l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire dans le eGME Cette fonction est impl\u00e9ment\u00e9e dans le eGME et elle est bien. On pourrait certes challenger les tables sur lesquelles elle repose, mais au final, cette fonction est tr\u00e8s utilisable. Un des probl\u00e8mes de game design est : quand invoquer cette fonction dans le jeu, surtout si l'on veut l'invoquer dans le cadre d'une question pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'oracle ? Quels sont les besoins ? # Une des fa\u00e7ons d'int\u00e9grer un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire dans le r\u00e9sultat de l'oracle est par exemple de d\u00e9clencher cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement sur un jet de d\u00e9s double avec 1d100. Cela fait une chance sur 10 d'avoir un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire. On pourrait aussi faire un test de chaos \u00e0 un certain moment, en fonction d'un r\u00e9sultat donn\u00e9 par l'oracle. L'oracle r\u00e9pond de mani\u00e8re classique les choses suivantes : Oui et... Oui Oui mais... Non mais... Non Non et... On pourrait convenir que d\u00e8s que l'oracle r\u00e9pond \"et...\" alors un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire se produit, soit positivement, soit n\u00e9gativement. Il est aussi possible de faire en sorte qu'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement al\u00e9atoire ne se produise qu'en cas de \"non et...\", car dans ce cas, potentiellement, il faut, dans tous les cas, que le joueur trouve une autre solution. Voil\u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de mes r\u00e9flexions sur le sujet. Pour le moment donc, le facteur de chaos n'est pas impl\u00e9ment\u00e9, mais j'y songe. 23 juillet 2022 La premi\u00e8re version de mon GME en ligne # C'est ici : GME (beta) Il fait pas mal de choses et est 100% utilisable offline. Il faudrait sans doute que j'harmonise les couleurs avec le site. Je commenterai une autre fois, je manque de temps. Pour m\u00e9moire, GME = Game Master Emulator. 26 juin 2022 Harry Potter le JDR, le top du top # Bon, je ne suis pas souvent impressionn\u00e9 par les productions fran\u00e7aises mais l\u00e0, force est de constater que nous avons un jeu d'une qualit\u00e9 remarquable. Comme je d\u00e9barque apr\u00e8s plus de deux d\u00e9cennies sans JDR, j'avoue que je connais pas Keul , l'auteur du jeu, mais son travail est vraiment remarquable : Harry Potter, le JDR Bon, certes, j'aime bien, le Basic RolePlaying (BRP) system de Chaosium , mais j'avoue que, lorsque j'ai trouv\u00e9 ce bijou sur Internet voil\u00e0 deux ans, cela m'a donn\u00e9 envie de rejouer... avec ma fille et ma femme. A tel point que j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Lulu de me l'imprimer. Je comprends qu'il y a un probl\u00e8me de droits, mais Keul devrait sans doute se rapprocher de J. K. Rowling ou de son agent, car son JDR est le plus complet et le mieux fait que l'on puisse voir sur le sujet (m\u00eame si d'autres ont tent\u00e9, en fran\u00e7ais). Bravo \u00e0 Keul encore pour ce travail impressionnant ! 06 juin 20222 Analyse de la table du destin de Mythic GME # Je travaille en ce moment \u00e0 une petite collection de programmes permettant de jouer en solo avec une construction d'histoire dynamique. Mon inspiration est Mythic GME . C'est pour moi une occasion de travailler sur le game design de ces GME , dans la continuit\u00e9 des sujets Grande Liste des intrigues de JDR et Morphologie du conte de Vladimir Propp. C'est un vieux sujet que je mature depuis quelques temps. La structuration de l'histoire via Mythic GME est un bon canevas sur lequel broder. Pour le moment, j'ai cod\u00e9 la table du destin dans les deux versions propos\u00e9es par Mythic : la version Mythic GME et la version Mythic GME Variation II . 04 juin 2022 A propos de Mal\u00e9fices # La table des paliers de Mal\u00e9fices 1e Faenyx a publi\u00e9 une \u00e9tude assez extensive de la derni\u00e8re \u00e9dition de Mal\u00e9fices. C'est ici : Premi\u00e8re partie , Deuxi\u00e8me partie , Troisi\u00e8me partie . A la lecture de cette critique, je ne suis pas tr\u00e8s chaud pour acheter. C'est mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 grognard, je suppose, mais l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, Lulu m'a permis de r\u00e9imprimer tous les anciens suppl\u00e9ments. J'ai m\u00eame fait r\u00e9imprimer un tarot qui est comme l'original mais en nettement mieux, avec des vraies cartes et tout et tout... C'est la magie de notre \u00e9poque. Rien n'est impossible sur Internet. 28 mai 2022 Lulu : de la joie pour les grognards, deuxi\u00e8me partie : Ghostbusters # Voil\u00e0, je les ai re\u00e7us ! L'origine du syst\u00e8me D6 ! La premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition de Ghostbusters RPG est sortie en 1986. Elle est \u00e9crite par : Sandy Petersen : on ne le pr\u00e9sente plus, le cr\u00e9ateur, entre autres, de l'Appel de Cthulhu ; Lynn Willis : impliqu\u00e9 sur Runequest, co-auteur de la campagne Les masques de Nyarlathotep ; Greg Stafford : l'inventeur de Glorantha et le p\u00e8re de Runequest. A l'\u00e9poque, tous ces gens sont chez Chaosium et West End Games (WEG) fait appel \u00e0 eux pour cr\u00e9er le jeu Ghostbusters. L'id\u00e9e est de cr\u00e9er un jeu tr\u00e8s simple permettant \u00e0 tous de jouer rapidement sans beaucoup de pr\u00e9paration et avec des D6 seulement. Le mat\u00e9riel de la bo\u00eete de base est riche : Ghostbusters a des c\u00f4t\u00e9s Call of Cthulhu, mais en mode \"fun\". Par exemple, la caract\u00e9ristique \"Cool\" est proche de la sant\u00e9 mentale, mais en plus large. On trouve aussi les fameux livres maudits, m\u00eame si, dans le cas de Ghostbusters, ces derniers parlent de fant\u00f4mes. Le gros morceau de la bo\u00eete est le \"Operations Manual\" dont voici le sommaire : J'ai retravaill\u00e9 les PDFs originaux trouv\u00e9s sur les sites de fans US pour avoir tout en un volume (scenarii inclus). Le manuel des op\u00e9rations est tr\u00e8s ax\u00e9 sur les aventures, ce qui est assez peu usuel pour une bo\u00eete de base. Pour la version Ghostbusters International (1989) , j'ai s\u00e9par\u00e9 le mat\u00e9riel en trois livres que l'on voit sur la photo : Les r\u00e8gles du jeu, Les sc\u00e9narios, Le \"Tobin's spirit Guide\". Environ 30\u20ac chez Lulu... Je ne suis vraiment pas pay\u00e9 pour leur faire de la pub, mais, c'est vraiment la joie chez les grognards ! Voir aussi la page sur la comparaison des syst\u00e8mes de jeu D6 . 28 mai 2022 Lulu : de la joie pour les grognards : Star Wars 1e # Je ne sais pas si je suis un Grognard mais Lulu me met en joie. Pourquoi ? Je ne suis pas contre acheter des vieux JDR. J'ai rat\u00e9 plus de 20 ans de l'histoire du hobby, j'ai donn\u00e9 quelques unes de mes reliques de JDR \u00e0 mon fr\u00e8re voil\u00e0 des ann\u00e9es (dont une bo\u00eete de D&D rouge 1e en fran\u00e7ais presque neuve !), c'est normal que je veuille combler mes lacunes avec des vieux trucs. Le probl\u00e8me, c'est que, ces vieilleries ne sont pas simples \u00e0 trouver et, quand on les trouve, elles sont souvent ch\u00e8res. Ces derniers temps, j'ai acquis pour quelques euros les 3 volumes de D&D 3.5 en \u00e9tat correct \u00e0 bon. A l'\u00e9tranger. J'ai aussi trouv\u00e9 M\u00e9ga 3 en \u00e9dition Descartes, \u00e9dition compl\u00e8tement scandaleuse (reprise avec les fautes du num\u00e9ro sp\u00e9cial de Casus avec une intro focalis\u00e9e sur les errata), mais acquise pour le sc\u00e9nario. J'ai aussi laiss\u00e9 dans mon pass\u00e9, une premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition fran\u00e7aise de Star Wars D6 WEG et le sourcebook qui allait avec. J'ai d\u00fb retravailler un peu les PDF qui se trouvent tr\u00e8s facilement, WEG ayant cess\u00e9 d'exister et je me suis fait une petite commande Lulu, le premier en cartonn\u00e9 super couleurs (un vrai fac-simil\u00e9 de l'\u00e9dition originale US) et le second en cartonn\u00e9 N&B, respectivement 28\u20ac et 10\u20ac. Je lisais l'autre fois dans le mail de Black Book que le papier devient cher, mais de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 je dois dire que je n'ai pas vu la diff\u00e9rence. Un fac-simil\u00e9 1e cartonn\u00e9 couleur pour moins de 30\u20ac, en France, c'est du jamais vu. J'ai pas mal utilis\u00e9 Lulu pour des livres, notamment des 18\u00e8me et 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cles, et franchement, c'est imbattable, que ce soit au niveau qualit\u00e9 ou au niveau prix. En plus, vous avez une \u00e9dition unique et c'est fait en France, d'o\u00f9 un d\u00e9lai moyen de deux semaines pour avoir les ouvrages. Raahah (r\u00e2le du grognard), je suis content ! Star Wars D6 est une \u00e9tape de plus dans mon exploration grognardesque des syst\u00e8mes de jeu D6, apr\u00e8s Risus et Ghostbusters. D'ailleurs, demain, je re\u00e7ois Ghostbusters 1e et 2e (international edition) avec tous les suppl\u00e9ments WEG en provenance directe de l'imprimeur fran\u00e7ais qui bosse pour Lulu ! Trop bon ! 26 mai 2022 Probabilit\u00e9s de x d6 contre y D6 (suite) # J'ai d\u00e9taill\u00e9 un peu l'explication des probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s de x d6 contre y d6 en combat dans une page d\u00e9di\u00e9e sur mon github . Il faudrait comparer avec des syst\u00e8mes de jeu ayant des scores de combat fixes et des moyens lin\u00e9aires de les tester. 24 mai 2022 La Grande Liste Des Intrigues de jeu de r\u00f4les # La Grande Liste des intrigues de jeu de r\u00f4les est une cr\u00e9ation de S. John Ross, l'inventeur de Risus . Ce suppl\u00e9ment gratuit vient d'un article que John a \u00e9crit en plusieurs versions et qui d\u00e9crit les intrigues g\u00e9n\u00e9riques de tous les sc\u00e9narios qu'il avait pu lire. En un sens, John Ross reprend le flambeau du livre de Vladimir Propp, la Morphologie du Conte . Ce livre est un jalon important dans l'analyse des contes de f\u00e9es dans la mesure o\u00f9 il prend le sujet par la structure des contes, et montre que, bien qu'en apparence tr\u00e8s nombreux et divers, tous les contes analys\u00e9s ob\u00e9issent \u00e0 une m\u00eame \"\u00e9quation\". Des ann\u00e9es plus tard, ayant d\u00e9couvert la Grande Liste, j'ai eu l'impression que John Ross red\u00e9couvrait ce m\u00eame concept. Sans aller jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9quation, ce dernier propose une liste d'intrigues, des variations et des possibles retournements, qui font que la plupart des intrigues de sc\u00e9narios semblent entrer dans ces quelques pages. Il fournit aussi un conseil trivial, mais \u00e0 ne pas oublier : dans les JDRs, l'intrigue est souvent simple ; ce sont les personnages qui la rendent attirante. L'intrigue n'est rien sans les r\u00f4les, ceux des PJs mais aussi ceux des PNJs qui donnent une couleur particuli\u00e8re. Je ne pense pas qu'il existait une version traduite avant celle que j'ai mis en ligne. A t\u00e9l\u00e9charger \u00e0 tout prix ! 23 mai 2022 Handel, M\u00e9ga et le jeu de r\u00f4les # Ecouter Ce disque m'a beaucoup marqu\u00e9. Il m'a fait aimer Handel. Quel rapport avec le JDR ? Aucun sans doute. Je lis les blogs de ceux qui n'ont jamais perdu le contact avec le jeu, et je me sens un peu \u00e9tranger. Je ne suis pas encore re-rentr\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement dedans. Tiens, sur le blog de Imaginos, un lien vers un topo sur M\u00e9ga 5 . Je vais attendre un peu. Je suis dans M\u00e9ga 3 et le 4, ayant trouv\u00e9 une bonne occase papier de M\u00e9ga 3 que je n'avais jamais lu. Dans tous les cas, on ne jouera sans doute jamais avec le moteur de jeu original, mais soit avec Risus et mon extension simpliste pour Risus M\u00e9ga , soit avec un autre moteur simpliste mais adapt\u00e9 aux pouvoirs psy. Comme je ne suis pas compl\u00e8tement satisfait du syst\u00e8me Risus, je regarde Ghostbusters et Troika qui me plaisent bien au niveau de m\u00e9canique de jeu simpliste. Ghostbusters est un jeu marrant qui a inspir\u00e9 Star Wars 1e avec sa m\u00e9canique de groupe de d6s (d6 pool). Troika est dans la continuit\u00e9 des jeux dont on est le h\u00e9ros. Je sais qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en fran\u00e7ais mais il ne semble pas (encore ?) disponible \u00e0 l'achat. Dans tous les cas, je suis en train de le traduire et de l'adapter de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9. H\u00e9 oui, je recherche encore un syst\u00e8me de jeu simpliste mais sympa pour jouer dans tous les univers. C'est mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 blaireau. 22 mai 2022 Machins de 2020 sur les ricains # Marrant, sur ce sujet, ma femme me disait que les am\u00e9ricains avaient un type de n\u00e9vrose collective tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciale : celle de n'avoir pas de pass\u00e9, ou plut\u00f4t de refouler leur pass\u00e9 /en tant qu'europ\u00e9ens/. Des choses, simples pour nous, les font r\u00eaver, particuli\u00e8rement le Moyen-Age. Pareil, sur un podcast de dicegeeks.com , j'ai entendu une discussions sur les dinosaures en tant que monstres dans les JDRs. \u00c9trange discussion de gens qui se rendent compte que visiter des labyrinthes (les fameux \"dungeons\") pour buter des monstres, c'est facile comme jeu mais c'est pas hyper sain, dans l'absolu. Une phrase excellente de Matt Davis : \"jouer comme \u00e7a \u00e0 D&D, c'est vraiment faire du wargame ; ce n'est pas du JDR\". Cela m'a fait penser \u00e0 tout un tas de choses qui font tripper les am\u00e9ricains, notamment des trucs moyen\u00e2geux tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diocres qui ne nous impressionnent pas, nous les Frenchies. En fait, D&D, c'est un peu le pass\u00e9 m\u00e9di\u00e9val fantasm\u00e9 des ricains crois\u00e9 avec des super-h\u00e9ros dans les grottes de Tolkien... Pas trop mon truc tout \u00e7a. 21 mai 2022 Enfin, les probabilit\u00e9s de x d6 contre y d6 ! # Ahah, je suis content de moi ! Cela fait un moment que je me pose des questions sur le syst\u00e8me D6. J'avais commenc\u00e9 sur le syst\u00e8me D6 ici : https://github.com/orey/jdr/tree/master/D6-System Je me souviens que j'avais beaucoup aim\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me de Star Wars avant de d\u00e9couvrir que des diff\u00e9rences de nombres de d\u00e9s \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s difficiles \u00e0 compenser. R\u00e9cemment, je me suis remis \u00e0 fond dans Risus et l\u00e0 encore, le syst\u00e8me Risus, surtout en mode combat, Clich\u00e9 contre Chich\u00e9, avec chaque clich\u00e9 ayant un certain nombre de d6, m'a fait me poser de grandes questions. Je suis revenu \u00e0 la source en analysant Ghostbusters (en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement gratuit sur le lien). Le syst\u00e8me est le m\u00eame, sans doute plus flexible que le syst\u00e8me Risus (j'y reviendrai). Je me suis dit que, vraisemblablement, des gens avaient d\u00fb travailler les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s d'un combat de 3d6 contre 4d6, par exemple. Je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9, si bien que j'ai fait un petit tableur et un petit programme pour pouvoir le calculer. Les r\u00e9sultats sont l\u00e0 : On voit bien sur ces deux tableaux l'ampleur des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. D\u00e8s que les deux combattants ont un d6 d'\u00e9cart, les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s chutent. Dans Risus, ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne peut \u00eatre compens\u00e9 par la Gonflette, mais cette derni\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteuse car, si elle permet de booster sur un round (il faut l'envisager dans un combat o\u00f9 l'on se sert de plusieurs Clich\u00e9s), le co\u00fbt ensuite de -1d6 est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s violent. Dans Ghostbusters, c'est plus malin, je trouve : on prend un bon point qui devient un d6 suppl\u00e9mentaire, histoire d'\u00eatre plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Et comme les PJs ont normalement plein de bons points, on peut en consommer quelques uns durant un combat. De m\u00e9moire, dans Star Wars, il y a aussi un moyen de \"booster\" pour compenser provisoirement le d\u00e9calage sur une action. Il faudrait que je regarde. 21 mai 2022 Des trucs sur Itch # Bon, voil\u00e0, j'ai publi\u00e9 quelques trucs gratuits sur Itch : https://rouboudou.itch.io En ce moment, je suis dans Risus . Je sais c'est un vieux truc mais c'est assez pratique pour jouer sur le pouce. J'ai un peu travaill\u00e9 un \u00e9cran en 3 volets qui commence \u00e0 \u00eatre sympa : Page 1 : toutes les r\u00e8gles de Risus en mode synth\u00e8se utilisable ; Page 2 : la table des probas, utile car nous sommes dans un monde de multiples D6 donc des probas avec une courbe en cloche ; Page 3 : des outils pour comprendre les Clich\u00e9s et cr\u00e9er des personnages amusants.

Quoi que le jeu ait eu une r\u00e9putation de jeu hyper-complexe, en tant que MJ, je me souviens d'avoir cass\u00e9 ma tirelire pour acheter les r\u00e8gles compl\u00e8tes. Nous avions \u00e0 faire \u00e0 un jeu suppos\u00e9ment g\u00e9n\u00e9rique et d\u00e9j\u00e0, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, le concept me s\u00e9duisait. J'avoue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 refroidi et \u00eatre rest\u00e9 perplexe devant la r\u00e9elle complexit\u00e9 du jeu. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venu.

Le travail sur le background \u00e9tait vraiment s\u00e9rieux mais je ne voyais pas comment je pouvais faire jouer ce jeu, en tous cas, pas avec le moteur de jeu original. Cela revient depuis plusieurs fois dans ce blog, mais \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, peu de gens avaient vraiment le temps ou les comp\u00e9tences d'adapter des suppl\u00e9ments d'un jeu pour un autre. La belle pochette de pochette de L\u00e9gendes des 1001 nuits est donc rest\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tag\u00e8re. Je l'ai toujours. L\u00e9gendes des mille et une nuits, un joli background pas facile d'acc\u00e8s Plus tard, dans une convention de jeux \u00e0 Morestel, je me d\u00e9cide \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 L\u00e9gendes Celtiques avec, manifestement, un MJ comp\u00e9tent ayant dig\u00e9r\u00e9 les folles m\u00e9caniques. Je m'en souviens encore... Sans parler de la longueur du processus de cr\u00e9ation des personnages, une fois \u00e0 la table, le bilan fut d\u00e9sastreux : apr\u00e8s 6 heures de jeu, nous n'en sommes toujours qu'au d\u00e9but du sc\u00e9nario. Nous avons principalement jou\u00e9 un combat d'une minute de jeu (60 secondes) en 4h30 ! H\u00e9 oui, le combat seconde par seconde... C'\u00e9tait trop pour moi. En fait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, que ce soit L\u00e9gendes Celtiques ou L\u00e9gendes des 1001 nuits , il faut voir qu'il \u00e9tait compliqu\u00e9 d'int\u00e9resser des joueurs \u00e0 ces univers. Jouer des Gaulois dans un monde avec de la magie \u00e0 la marge , ce n'est pas tr\u00e8s facile.

La fantasy s'appuie sur un imaginaire m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique tr\u00e8s mall\u00e9able et tr\u00e8s ouvert, et les jeux d'horreur contemporaine se situent dans des univers proches du n\u00f4tre.

Mais pourquoi cumuler les deux difficult\u00e9s ? Cette question m'a souvent turlupin\u00e9. Mettons que je sois cr\u00e9ateur de JDR : je fais un effort sur l'univers, supposons la Gaule.

La s\u00e9rie Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes commet, selon moi, deux erreurs fondamentales : Elle reprend la marque L\u00e9gendes , qui avait quand m\u00eame une connotation n\u00e9gative de jeu injouable ; Elle ajoute le terme Premi\u00e8res qui produit une r\u00e9elle catastrophe marketing. Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes de la Table Ronde L\u00e0 o\u00f9 D&D propose deux s\u00e9ries, le D&D \"normal\" et un jeu \"advanced\", AD&D pour les joueurs confirm\u00e9s, Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes donne l'impression d'un jeu pour les enfants (alors qu'il est encore hyper-complexe), c'est le marketing AD&D \u00e0 l'envers ! En plus, la couverture est hideuse ! L'effet est donc incroyablement percutant : Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes, c'est comme le jeu hypercomplexe, mais pour les blaireaux (sous-entendu les non r\u00f4listes). Il aurait fallu, je pense : Trouver un autre nom, Trouver un autre syst\u00e8me de jeux, pour rendre plus accessible ces univers... Bon, je sais, ce que je propose ressemble un peu \u00e0 l'approche de GURPS . Ce qui est incompr\u00e9hensible, c'est que Descartes re-signe pour trois produits des plus confus. La Table Ronde sort en 1986, soit un an apr\u00e8s la parution de Pendragon aux Etats-Unis, la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e que la traduction en fran\u00e7ais dudit jeu chez Gallimard (un travail de cochon). Le jeu qui n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec la Table Ronde, aurait d\u00fb s'appeler L\u00e9gendes du Moyen-Age . Il se passe au XIII\u00e8me si\u00e8cle et est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s historique... L\u00e9gendes Celtiques en 1987, rajoute \u00e0 la confusion, en particulier des suppl\u00e9ments : est-ce qu'un uppl\u00e9ment L\u00e9gendes Celtiques est utilisable avec (Premi\u00e8res) L\u00e9gendes Celtiques sachant que le syst\u00e8me de jeu est \"presque\" compatible mais pas compl\u00e8tement ? Mais pourquoi se lancer dans un tel imbroglio ? Parfois, il faut savoir abandonner une marque... L\u00e9gendes de la Vall\u00e9e des Rois en 1988 apporte un peu d'air frais \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie gr\u00e2ce au travail de Christian Caroli . Mais l\u00e0 encore, m\u00eame si le produit est travaill\u00e9, l'accessibilit\u00e9 du jeu est super super faible, tellement que cela signera l'arr\u00eat de mort de la gamme. Encart positif : Si vous voulez jouer en 2022 des chevaliers, jouez \u00e0 Pendragon . Si vous voulez jouer des gaulois, malheureusement, \u00e7a va \u00eatre chaud : regardez sur la sc\u00e8ne des JDR indie des fois que quelqu'un ait eu l'id\u00e9e d'adapter L\u00e9gendes \u00e0 un moteur de jeu jouable ; ou alors Jouez \u00e0 GURPS Celtic Myths. GURPS Celtic Myths Si vous voulez jouer dans le monde des Pharaons, je vous conseille GURPS Egypt. Ou alors quelqu'un devra faire l'effort d'adapter le contenu de M. Caroli \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de jeu moins d\u00e9bile. GURPS Egypt Sur ce dernier jeu, ne nous m\u00e9prenons pas, je pense que la qualit\u00e9 du contenu fran\u00e7ais est meilleure , mais la jouabilit\u00e9 est bien moindre. Donc, il faut faire un choix : Soit ceux qui poss\u00e8dent les droits de L\u00e9gendes de la Vall\u00e9e des Rois font un reboot avec le m\u00eame contenu \u00e9dit\u00e9 autrement, par quelqu'un d'autre, et pour un autre syst\u00e8me de jeu, jouable, celui-l\u00e0 (et pourquoi pas pour plusieurs... oulala, c'est chaud !), sachant que les joueurs d'aujourd'hui sont encore moins sensibles \u00e0 l'univers ; Soit le travail peut rester dans les limbes, et on joue \u00e0 autre chose ou alors on joue \u00e0 GURPS en anglais. Moi, j'ai un travail full time, donc sur ce coup-ci, ce n'est pas moi qui vous aiderait. Blague \u00e0 part.

En fait, c'est tout le contraire chez les am\u00e9ricains - alors que souvent, le jeu est l'oeuvre d'une seule personne (au moins au d\u00e9but) : Des jeux play-test\u00e9s, Une accessibilit\u00e9 travaill\u00e9e, et retravaill\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque \u00e9dition (aussi parce que les joueurs changent, et donc les demandes du \"march\u00e9\" changent), Un suivi avec des suppl\u00e9ments, ce qui veut dire que les gens croient au jeu et que le jeu a une vraie \"part de march\u00e9\" (oulala le gros mot en France, berk !).","title":"Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes, le d\u00e9sastre"},{"location":"blog/2022/#bref","text":"Je suis peut-\u00eatre n\u00e9gatif mais nous avons l\u00e0 l'exemple type de la pr\u00e9tention fran\u00e7aise : Des jeux tr\u00e8s complexes, Dans des univers difficiles d'acc\u00e8s pour les joueurs, Aucun suivi (les fran\u00e7ais n'aiment pas le support apr\u00e8s-vente), Un marketing tr\u00e8s nase, Et surtout... une bonne grosse dose de pr\u00e9tention de faire mieux que les ricains, parce que, attention, nous on est cultiv\u00e9s et on sait jouer dans des mondes historiques de profs d'histoire (avec un peu de magie, mais pas trop quand m\u00eame sinon, c'est trop de la superstition, \u00e7a fait pas assez rationnel et cultiv\u00e9), Une compr\u00e9hension faible des r\u00e8gles de base du business (faire plaisir \u00e0 ses clients et non \u00e0 ses copains).

Vous me direz, c'est \u00e9vident. En fait oui. Prenons le cas d'un combat avec AFF et donc un combat avec COMP+2d6+Talent contre un monstre ayant COMP+2d6 . Il s'agit donc de comparer les courbes de deux entit\u00e9s ayant 2d6+A et 2d6+B et de les comparer avec le cas o\u00f9 l'on utiliserait un d12 .

Froika! risque donc d'\u00eatre un syst\u00e8me d12 qui sera donc compatible avec Troika! et AFF mais en plus lin\u00e9aire. Il reste juste \u00e0 limiter la COMP \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du perso.

Il faut tester le PJ pour savoir s'il r\u00e9ussit ou pas. Selon les jeux, la comp\u00e9tence test\u00e9e (parfois appel\u00e9e caract\u00e9ristique, talent, ou autre) est soit une constante (par exemple 45% ou 12 ), soit quelque chose de variable (par exemple 4d6 ou 1d8 ). Le test peut prendre deux une des deux grandes formes suivantes : Si la comp\u00e9tence est une constante , le jet de d\u00e9s permet de se mesurer \u00e0 elle : il faut faire soit inf\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence (courant), soit sup\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal (plus rare). Si la comp\u00e9tence est une variable , le MJ doit d\u00e9terminer un facteur de difficult\u00e9 : le jet devra donc battre ce facteur, souvent sup\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal \u00e0 ce dernier. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les syst\u00e8mes de JDR g\u00e8rent ce cas sans probl\u00e8me notable. Il faut juste s'assurer que les statistiques ne soient pas tordues (voir l'article sur les syst\u00e8mes D6 ). Il faut noter une diff\u00e9rence importante sur les tests \u00e0 base de comp\u00e9tence : le test de la comp\u00e9tence constante n'oblige pas le MJ \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer un facteur de difficult\u00e9 dans la plupart des cas. Des bonus et malus peuvent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s dans des cas exceptionnels mais le joueur conna\u00eet sa chance de r\u00e9ussite de base dans tous les cas. Par exemple, sur un syst\u00e8me en pourcentage, si je poss\u00e8de 60% dans une comp\u00e9tence, je comprend imm\u00e9diatement mes chances de r\u00e9ussite, le d100 \u00e9tant, de plus, une distribution statistique lin\u00e9aire (ce qui n'est pas le cas de 3d6 par exemple). Les syst\u00e8mes \u00e0 seuil de difficult\u00e9 ont le d\u00e9savantage de faire appel au MJ pour toutes les situations, ce qui, \u00e0 la longue, peut entra\u00eener un sentiment d'arbitraire chez les joueurs. J'avoue que personnellement, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re les jets contre des scores de comp\u00e9tences fixes. Comme j'\u00e9vite les bonus/malus, sauf cas exceptionnel ou sc\u00e8ne cruciale, le jeu va plus vite.","title":"Gestion des tests simples"},{"location":"blog/2022/#les-deux-grands-problemes-a-resoudre","text":"En fait, \u00e0 mon avis, les deux grands probl\u00e8mes de conception d'un syst\u00e8me de JDR sont les suivants : \u00c9quilibrer les combats (m\u00eal\u00e9e et \u00e0 distance entre les joueurs et les adversaires), \u00c9quilibrer la magie (ou les pouvoirs psy), \u00e0 la fois entre les joueurs (pour un certain \u00e9quilibre du groupe) et avec les adversaires. Certains jeux comme Call Of Cthulhu simplifient un peu le probl\u00e8me en d\u00e9clarant que la magie est finalement r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux adversaires (fous). Certes, un PJ peut conna\u00eetre un sort, mais pas au sens D&D . D'autres jeux comme D&D deviennent int\u00e9ressants d\u00e8s lors que tous les PJs sont d'un niveau suffisant, et donc que les PJs ayant des sorts peuvent les utiliser. Dans les premiers niveaux, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9. Et, \u00e0 plus haut niveau, l'\u00e9quilibre redevient compliqu\u00e9 (et n'est pas le m\u00eame suivant les \u00e9ditions). D'autres jeux comme Ars Magica pr\u00e9viennent d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but que le magicien sera le plus fort et de loin (et donc les PJs ne sont pas \u00e9quilibr\u00e9s).

Advanced Fighting Fantasy - Dungeoneer L'extension concerne deux dimensions : Des talents (comp\u00e9tences avanc\u00e9es ou advanced skills ), Un syst\u00e8me de magie. Les talents fonctionnent comme des bonus, par exemple un talent de combat \u00e0 l'\u00e9p\u00e9e de 2 donnera un bonus de 2 lors du combat contre l'adversaire. Ainsi, le joueur tirera COMP+2D6+2 contre un adversaire. Le joueur a COMP points \u00e0 r\u00e9partir dans ses talents. La syst\u00e8me de magie est assez malin et en deux temps : A la cr\u00e9ation du PJ, le joueur doit choisir de combien de points il ampute sa COMP pour cr\u00e9er son score de magie (pris sur les points de comp\u00e9tences avanc\u00e9es). Supposons que j'ai tir\u00e9 1d6+6 pour ma COMP et que j'obtienne 10 . Je d\u00e9cide d'affecter 4 points \u00e0 la magie. J'aurais donc COMP=6 et Magie (4) . Pour r\u00e9ussir un sort, je devrai donc faire un jet sous ma COMP+Magie , ce qui est ma COMP initiale. Suivant la difficult\u00e9 du sort, je perdrai un certain nombre de PdV . Cela signifie aussi que pour toutes mes autres comp\u00e9tences non magiques, ma COMP restera \u00e0 6 et donc j'aurai moins de chances de r\u00e9ussite structurellement . Le nombre de points restant pour les autres talents est de COMP-Magie= 10-4=6 ce qui \u00e9quilibre la magie avec les autres comp\u00e9tences. \u00c9videmment, dans ce syst\u00e8me, on peut se poser la question si faire un jet de 2d6 sous la COMP+Comp\u00e9tence avanc\u00e9e n'est pas un peu facile. Il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans le jeu qu'un 12 est toujours un \u00e9chec, mais effectivement, on retrouve l'aspect un peu \"facile\" de Fighting Fantasy original.","title":"La fa\u00e7on de Dungeoneer de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me"},{"location":"blog/2022/#la-facon-troika","text":"Troika! prend une approche encore plus simple sur deux dimensions : La COMP est tir\u00e9e avec 1d3+3 seulement, ce qui rend les jets sous la COMP+Comp\u00e9tence avanc\u00e9e (beaucoup) plus difficiles (trop sans doute) ; La connaissance d'un sort est un talent comme un autre (m\u00eame si l'utilisation des sorts fait perdre des points de vie).

D\u00e8s que j'ai fini la traduction de Troika! (nom actuel Froika! ), je me lance dans l'adaptation \u00e0 M\u00e9ga . M\u00eame si j'aime beaucoup l'univers et le travail remarquable fait dans le cadre de l' Encyclop\u00e9die Galactique , je trouve que de nombreux points n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exploit\u00e9s. Tout d'abord, la timeline d\u00e9crite dans M\u00e9ga 3 et \u00e9toff\u00e9e dans M\u00e9ga 4 reste \u00e9vasive et des d\u00e9tails manquent quant \u00e0 l' Eclipse des Soleils et les fameuses Choses du Vide . Ensuite, le fait de pouvoir transiter est d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelque chose de potentiellement d\u00e9stabilisant pour une nation galactique (possibilit\u00e9 de vois des arm\u00e9es d\u00e9barquer par des t\u00e9tra\u00e8dres), mais le fait de pouvoir se transf\u00e9rer dans quelqu'un d'autre pose un probl\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 galactique . Il est donc obligatoire que certains \u00e9tats aient, \u00e0 un moment, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la Guilde comme une menace \u00e0 \u00e9liminer. Ou alors, il \u00e9tait obligatoire que certains ren\u00e9gats aient une envie folle de prendre le contr\u00f4le de royaumes ou de l'AG. Je me souviens des livres de Philip Dick : quand un monde est empli de gens ayant des pouvoirs psy, toute la \"texture\" du monde est diff\u00e9rente. Je pense que les potentialit\u00e9s de M\u00e9ga n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exploit\u00e9es compl\u00e8tement. On en est rest\u00e9 \u00e0 un monde un peu bisounours o\u00f9 les M\u00e9gas se baladent comme ils veulent avec des pouvoirs capables de changer le cours de l'histoire (le sujet est en filigrane dans M\u00e9ga 2).

J'ai (re)d\u00e9couvert pas mal de choses : L'ind\u00e9cision totale du journal et son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre un sujet tr\u00e8s longtemps. L'incompr\u00e9hensible soutien \u00e0 Simulacres , ce jeu compl\u00e8tement merdique, malgr\u00e9 les efforts d\u00e9mentiels de son auteur pour l'imposer de force et en mettre de partout, alors qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, les syst\u00e8mes D&D et AdC \u00e9taient les plus pratiqu\u00e9s. Au lieu de faire des pages et des pages pour Simulacres , pourquoi ne pas traduire les sc\u00e9narios pour les diff\u00e9rents syst\u00e8mes de jeux ? Avec le recul, on voit que l'Heroic Fantasy \u00e0 la D&D ou l'horreur lovecraftienne \u00e0 la Call Of Cthulhu passent par tous les syst\u00e8mes... L'incompr\u00e9hensible sp\u00e9cialisation des sc\u00e9narios \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de jeu. Par exemple, tout sc\u00e9nario D&D aurait pu avoir sa traduction pour Runequest ou Warhammer . Je crois avoir vu cela dans un seul num\u00e9ro de Casus. Et comment font les joueurs ? Ils font la traduction seuls ? Ils sont suppos\u00e9s conna\u00eetre tous les jeux et poss\u00e9der tous les suppl\u00e9ments ? H\u00e9 non, ils sont suppos\u00e9s les jouer avec Simulacres ! L'hyperfocalisation sur Shadowrun qui n'est tout de m\u00eame pas le jeu du si\u00e8cle. Des sc\u00e9narios sur des jeux de troisi\u00e8me zone, hyper-sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, impossibles \u00e0 trouver en boutique \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et tellement sp\u00e9cifiques qu'ils en \u00e9taient impossibles \u00e0 adapter. Un soutien absolu \u00e0 R\u00eave de Dragon que, franchement, personne ne jouait autour de moi. Bon, OK, Denis Gerfaud est sympa, mais quand m\u00eame. Je m'\u00e9tais toujours demand\u00e9 pourquoi Pendragon n'avait pas perc\u00e9 en France, mais c'\u00e9tait parce que tout le monde voulait faire la promo des L\u00e9gendes de la Table Ronde qui, vu de moi, fut un bide complet (la traduction nase de Gallimard en 1986 n'a pas aid\u00e9). Dans les Casus premi\u00e8re version, \u00e0 un certain moment, on en arrive un moment au comble : l'auteure du jeu LDLTR (Anne V\u00e9tillard) \u00e9crivant des sc\u00e9narios pour Pendragon ! On cro\u00eet r\u00eaver ! Pourquoi avoir gard\u00e9 des pages sur les wargames ? Il y avait des lecteurs ? Et la pub... Mon dieu, tant de pubs... Au final, quand on se tape tous les Casus premi\u00e8re mouture, on comprend comment, petit \u00e0 petit, le public a fui. Sur certains num\u00e9ros, il n'y a rien \u00e0 garder, m\u00eame du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des sc\u00e9narios.

Cela fait un moment que je me pose des questions sur le syst\u00e8me D6. J'avais commenc\u00e9 sur le syst\u00e8me D6 ici : https://github.com/orey/jdr/tree/master/D6-System Je me souviens que j'avais beaucoup aim\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me de Star Wars avant de d\u00e9couvrir que des diff\u00e9rences de nombres de d\u00e9s \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s difficiles \u00e0 compenser.

Je suis revenu \u00e0 la source en analysant Ghostbusters (en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement gratuit sur le lien). Le syst\u00e8me est le m\u00eame, sans doute plus flexible que le syst\u00e8me Risus (j'y reviendrai). Je me suis dit que, vraisemblablement, des gens avaient d\u00fb travailler les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s d'un combat de 3d6 contre 4d6, par exemple. Je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9, si bien que j'ai fait un petit tableur et un petit programme pour pouvoir le calculer. Les r\u00e9sultats sont l\u00e0 : On voit bien sur ces deux tableaux l'ampleur des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. D\u00e8s que les deux combattants ont un d6 d'\u00e9cart, les probabilit\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s chutent. Dans Risus, ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne peut \u00eatre compens\u00e9 par la Gonflette, mais cette derni\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteuse car, si elle permet de booster sur un round (il faut l'envisager dans un combat o\u00f9 l'on se sert de plusieurs Clich\u00e9s), le co\u00fbt ensuite de -1d6 est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s violent. Dans Ghostbusters, c'est plus malin, je trouve : on prend un bon point qui devient un d6 suppl\u00e9mentaire, histoire d'\u00eatre plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Et comme les PJs ont normalement plein de bons points, on peut en consommer quelques uns durant un combat.

J'\u00e9tais en train de r\u00e9organiser mon repo D&D qui commence \u00e0 contenir plein de choses, quand je suis tomb\u00e9 sur le premier manuscrit OD&D dit Manuscript Dallhun , aussi d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 Beyond This Point Be Dragons (le texte est dans le repo). J'ai lu, voil\u00e0 quelques temps, que cette mention figurait sur les cartes anciennes en bordure des cartes quand les cartographes ne savaient pas ce qui se trouvait au del\u00e0. J'ai recherch\u00e9 des cartes de ce genre et j'avour n'avoir pas trouv\u00e9 grand chose, comme quoi, cette mention serait, dans une large partie, une l\u00e9gende. Pas m\u00eame une carte ? non, un seul globe ! # Il existe un seul globe (le globe de Hunt-Lenox ) qui porte une mention de ce type, globe datant de 1510 et que l'on peut trouver sur le site de la biblioth\u00e8que publique de New York . Mais, quand on regarde bien la mention, on voit qu'il n'est pas \u00e9crit tout \u00e0 fait \"Here be dragons\". Il est \u00e9crit : ANF UROIN HC SUNT DRACONES Traduction # Je pr\u00e9viens de suite : je ne suis pas latiniste et n'ait pas la pr\u00e9tention de bien traduire et donc n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 m'\u00e9crire si vous avez des traductions plus convaincantes que ce qui va suivre. Nous prendrons pour premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8se que HC est une abr\u00e9viation de hunc , ou de hic . Extrait du Dictionnaire des abr\u00e9viations latines et fran\u00e7aises usit\u00e9es dans les inscriptions lapidaires et m\u00e9talliques, les manuscrits et les chartes du Moyen-Age Pour ce qui est de la premi\u00e8re ligne, il semblerait que l'on puisse d\u00e9composer les mots en : AN FURO IN . Cela reviendrait \u00e0 : An furo in hunc sunt dracones. Une traduction pourrait \u00eatre : Est-ce que les dragons sont en col\u00e8re ici ? ou encore Est-ce que ces dragons sont furieux ? HC pourrait aussi \u00eatre une abr\u00e9viation de hic ce qui ferait An furo in hic sunt dracones , ce qui donne un sens l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rent. Une traduction possible serait : Est-ce que les dragons sont en train de se d\u00e9cha\u00eener ? ou Y a-t-il des dragons furieux ici ? \u00c9videmment, si l'on omet le d\u00e9but de la phrase et que l'on ne garde que hic sunt dracones , on peut traduire par voici les dragons ou les dragons sont ici . HC veut aussi dire dans d'autres contextes : H.C. : hic condiderunt , ils ont fond\u00e9 ici ; H.C. : Hispania citerior , l'Espagne est meilleure . mais je ne pense pas que ce soit tr\u00e8s applicable. Conclusion # Enfin, tout \u00e7a pour dire que la vision US de la citation prend une citation tronqu\u00e9e, ce qui me rend perplexe. Dans les ann\u00e9es 70, quand le JDR na\u00eet avec cette soif d'exploration, ce qui est une anecdote historique due \u00e0 une seule personne est \u00e0 l'origine du nom d'un des plus vieux manuscrits de JDR : le manuscrit Dalluhn. Voir ici . 04 novembre 2023 Diverses choses # Les pouvoirs psioniques de Eldritch Wizardry de OD&D # Voil\u00e0, la traduction et la mise en page sont termin\u00e9es et le PDF est disponible depuis le 30 ao\u00fbt l\u00e0 ainsi que sur itch.io . Ce fut un gros travail, surtout que la seconde partie propose une remise en ordre des r\u00e8gles en mode fouillis que l'on trouve dans le manuel original. Je comprends pourquoi un certain nombre de gens ont fait des clones \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de D&D 3/3.5 sur les premi\u00e8res versions de D&D*. Ces versions sont simples et permettent de jouer \u00e0 l'ancienne. C'est quoi jouer Old School ? # J'arrive 20 ans apr\u00e8s la bataille mais j'ai remis une pi\u00e8ce dans le forum de DDD . \"OSR pour moi, c'est d'abord \u00eatre \"libre\" en tant que joueur, c'est faire ce que l'on veut. Cela veut dire partir de la ville alors que le sc\u00e9nario doit se passer l\u00e0, tuer le gentil par erreur et finir ses jours en prison apr\u00e8s un proc\u00e8s en grande pompe et une s\u00e9ance de fouet en place publique devant la famille de celui que l'on \u00e9tait suppos\u00e9 aider, aller dans un donjon et ressortir sans avoir tu\u00e9 le grand Manitou parce que plus de vivres et plus de torches, etc. C'est aussi s'amuser dans les combats avec trois fois rien de r\u00e8gles : faire des cascades, tenter des choses \u00e0 la noix comme se battre en escaladant une statue, couper la tentacule qui vous soul\u00e8ve du sol (et se vautrer sur un tapis de kobolds), jeter des choses au visage des adversaires, se jeter des armes entre amis au lieu de ramasser une \u00e9p\u00e9e qui a gliss\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre bout de la pi\u00e8ce, se battre sur une passerelle en feu ou dans un bateau entra\u00een\u00e9 par des rapides, etc. C'est d\u00e9jouer des pi\u00e8ges marrants (et possiblement meurtriers), c'est aller dans des endroits qui font peur, c'est aller vite en \u00e9vitant les combats parce que les monstres errants n'ont pas de tr\u00e9sors sur eux et ne on ne veut pas risquer de mourir pour rien, c'est avoir un objet magique qui est top et qu'on utilise tant qu'on peut dans toutes les situations saugrenues, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que quelqu'un ait envie de nous le voler ou ne nous donne pas le choix que de le c\u00e9der pour sortir vivants d'un mauvais pas. C'est aussi rencontrer des PNJ tr\u00e8s courtois mais hyper dangereux dont on ne conna\u00eet pas les pouvoirs et qui peuvent \u00eatre susceptibles, c'est \u00eatre oblig\u00e9s de faire une qu\u00eate parce que le client a un moyen de pression sur vous, c'est avoir peur dans un monde de fantasy o\u00f9 l'on ne sait pas \u00e0 qui on \u00e0 faire, c'est jouer avec les circonstances dans un monde hostile et donc peu tol\u00e9rant aux grosses conneries, c'est trouver des alli\u00e9s, ou inventer une belle histoire que le MJ accepte d'int\u00e9grer sur le pouce de mon oncle gladiateur \u00e0 la retraite qui connaissait le milieu du crime, c'est faire face \u00e0 des monstres qui ont peur et qui partent en courant parce que la moiti\u00e9 de leur groupe a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cim\u00e9e, ou qui veulent bien n\u00e9gocier si on leur donne la dague qui \u00e9claire \"pour donne plus facilement la t\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 mes petits ch\u00e9ris\", c'est tomber dans un pi\u00e8ge o\u00f9 il faut se marier ou s'engager 20 ans dans l'arm\u00e9e du Duc Morein ayant pour mission de nettoyer la plaine de Barzail de ses habitations troglodytes trolls... Mais c'est pour moi, avant tout la libert\u00e9 d'incarner un personnage sans regarder sa feuille, ses comp\u00e9tences, ses talents et tous ses bonus (on les conna\u00eet). Pour un MJ, cela veut dire improvisation (et tables al\u00e9atoires), ouverture d'esprit, surfer sur les id\u00e9es des joueurs, sur leurs d\u00e9fauts aussi, c'est se laisser baratiner (sans jet de d\u00e9s), arbitrer dans le sens \"on va voir si le truc loufoque que vous tentez marche\", c'est conna\u00eetre les r\u00e8gles tellement par c\u0153ur que jamais on ne regarde le manuel, c'est jouer des PNJ qui peuvent trouver trouver un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 une situation, ou sont joueurs avec les joueurs, ou sont mauvais et fomentent, ou ont un c\u00f4t\u00e9 singulier que les joueurs n'oublieront pas. Et pour moi, c'est vraiment top quand il y a quelque chose \u00e0 comprendre dans le sc\u00e9nario (m\u00eame si les joueurs peuvent aller off-track complet et qu'ils ne comprendront peut-\u00eatre jamais en ratant le maigre fil conducteur qu'ils pourront peut-\u00eatre rependre dans une autre session sous une autre forme). Il faut que ce soit amusant et qu'il y ait du rythme, que les gens vivent quelque chose qui ne ressemble pas \u00e0 quelque chose de trop lin\u00e9aire, de trop sc\u00e9naris\u00e9 (genre DL). Par contre le donjon exploration doit, \u00e0 mon sens, alterner avec des choses \u00e0 l'air libre, des chemins, des ruines, des for\u00eats, des villages, des montagnes, des endroits hostiles desquels on se prot\u00e8ge partiellement via diverses protections magiques, des peuples \u00e9tranges, des PNJs, des PNJs et des PNJs... Car OSR ou pas, il faut jouer des r\u00f4les ! En PJ, la vision OSR de Matthew Finch (Swords and Wizardry) et un document bizarre sur un \"gourou\" en OSR donnant des le\u00e7ons d'OSR (en anglais les deux mais sympas \u00e0 lire).\" Un bon forum et un bon site que j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9 plusieurs fois. Lexique de traduction D&D # Cela m'am\u00e8ne au sujet de la traduction de D&D. Trois sites francophones (que j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9s) proposent des traductions et beaucoup de contenu : La Forge de Papier , manifestement en pause de puis peu, maintenant apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9norme travail accompli ces derniers temps, on peut comprendre ; Le Donjon du Dragon avec \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de contenu accessible aux membres ; Aide D&D d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 D&D 5e avec en gros tout le contenu disponible librement en fran\u00e7ais (ce qui est assez \u00e9norme en fait, montrant que WotC n'est pas si m\u00e9chant que \u00e7a, on voudrait bien voir \u00e7a chez une bo\u00eete de JDR fran\u00e7aise). Le sujet de la traduction se pose car, mal traduits, les suppl\u00e9ments D&D peuvent devenir injouables, et on peut affirmer que pas mal de traductions sont vraiment mauvaises. J'ai eu acc\u00e8s au lexique D&D BECMI de DDD et il faut que j'ajoute les traductions que je propose pour Eldritch Wizardry qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en fran\u00e7ais. Il faut aussi que je poursuivre mon repo git sur le sujet. Empire Galactique # J'ai mis la main r\u00e9cemment sur la premi\u00e8re version d' Empire Galactique de 1984. On est l\u00e0, typiquement, dans le jeu qui aurait pu cartonner mais deux p\u00e9ch\u00e9s (habituels en France) ont tu\u00e9 le jeu : Apr\u00e8s la publication de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, un seul suppl\u00e9ment est publi\u00e9, un recueil de 5 sc\u00e9narios, Aux fronti\u00e8res de l'Empire , et il faudra attendre 1987, soit plus de deux ans plus tard pour voir appara\u00eetre l' Encyclop\u00e9die Galactique , qui ne propose pas de sc\u00e9narios mais d\u00e9taille le background du jeu. Fin 1987, alors que tout le monde attendait des sc\u00e9narios, le jeu sort... dans une nouvelle \u00e9dition en poche avec de nouvelles r\u00e8gles ! Cela ach\u00e8vera de tuer le jeu, car en 1988, Star Wars D6 d\u00e9barque en fran\u00e7ais et rel\u00e9guera Empire Galactique \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de souvenir. Cette nouvelle version des r\u00e8gles fait appara\u00eetre des pictogrammes. Je ne sais pas ce que les autres en pensent, mais je fais une allergie compl\u00e8te \u00e0 ce genre de pr\u00e9sentation pour les d\u00e9biles, que ce soit dans Empire Galactique , dans l'horrible Simulacres , ou m\u00eame dans Star Wars FFG . Je ne sais pas d'o\u00f9 sort l'id\u00e9e saugrenue que des pictogrammes seront plus faciles \u00e0 manipuler pour les joueurs et le MJ que des mots et des nombres. Le suivi des gammes fran\u00e7aises # Le manque de suivi dans les gammes (fran\u00e7aises) est une maladie fran\u00e7aise dont j'ai souvent parl\u00e9 en ces pages. En relisant un vieux Dragon Radieux r\u00e9cemment, j'ai retrouv\u00e9 un article de Paul Chion qui se plaignait de la m\u00eame chose. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, quand il est devenu \u00e9diteur, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 face un peu au m\u00eame probl\u00e8me : Empires et Dynasties n'a eu que trois suppl\u00e9ments et a fait face au probl\u00e8me incarn\u00e9 par le jeu fait par un seul cr\u00e9ateur ; Hurlements a \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu plus suivi mais le th\u00e8me tr\u00e8s \u00e9troit (et un peu id\u00e9ologique) au final tourn\u00e9 court. H\u00e9 oui, le jeu fait tout seul par un auteur unique qui est bon dans tout, \u00e7a tourne court, souvent, sauf peut-\u00eatre pour R\u00eave de Dragon r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 par une communaut\u00e9 de fans, ou pour INS/MV . Il a aussi fait face \u00e0 la faillite, alors que d'autres ont fait face au rachat puis au changement de strat\u00e9gie, par exemple Siroz devenu Id\u00e9ojeux devenu Asmod\u00e9e qui a rachet\u00e9 Jeux Descartes pour, finalement, faire autre chose que du JDR, et pour \u00eatre finalement rachet\u00e9 par Embracer . 24 septembre 2023 Des trucs sur D&D # Bon, l\u00e0, \u00e9videmment, je suis immerg\u00e9 dans D&D ce qui, je pense, ne m'est jamais arriv\u00e9 auparavant. Commencer par OD&D est une exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante qui m'inspire quelques commentaires. OD&D : une profusion d'id\u00e9es # Comme dans touts les innovations, le d\u00e9but est souvent tr\u00e8s fertile en id\u00e9es, en tentatives, en ouverture d'esprit. Prenons un exemple non tir\u00e9 du monde des JDR : prenons l'informatique. Lorsque la programmation orient\u00e9e objet est n\u00e9e, de nombreuses questions ont foisonn\u00e9 dans tous les sens cr\u00e9ant diverses choses \u00e9tranges qui ont un jour abouti \u00e0 (horreur) C++. Plus que C++, le livre de Gamma et al. de 1994, Design Patterns, elements of reusable object-oriented software a terrass\u00e9 toute r\u00e9flexion : le livre \u00e9tait intelligent, puissant, lourd, construit. Il permit l'\u00e9mergence de softwares professionnels mais au d\u00e9triment de l'innovation. Oubli\u00e9es toutes les id\u00e9es innovantes. Nous \u00e9tions revenus au monde industriel. Globalement, les id\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9es pendant presque 20 ans et il a fallu attendre le d\u00e9veloppement de Javascript pour voir un mod\u00e8le diff\u00e9rent \u00e9merger. OD&D, c'est un peu la m\u00eame chose. Quoique mis en forme de fa\u00e7on difficile \u00e0 lire et \u00e0 exploiter, OD&D est un capharna\u00fcm d'inventions. On pourrait croire au premier abord que toutes ces listes de choses sont un r\u00e9pertoire plus ou moins h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8ne mais, la plupart du temps, ces listes mod\u00e9lisent diff\u00e9rents \u00e9l\u00e9ments de diff\u00e9rents mondes de fantaisie que l'on trouve dans les livres de fantasy de diff\u00e9rents auteurs (voir les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de GaryGygax ici ). De plus, les diverses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de mod\u00e9lisation de ces mondes renvoient les uns aux autres : les sorts renvoient aux monstres qui renvoient aux objets magiques. Toutes ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences permettent de mod\u00e9liser plusieurs univers mais on distingue, malgr\u00e9 une mise en page un peu compliqu\u00e9e, un vrai souci de coh\u00e9rence parmi ces \"sous-groupes\". Par exemple, \u00e0 l'usage, il para\u00eet difficile de joueur \u00e0 OD&D sans prendre quelques options de Greyhawk . En effet, le mod\u00e8le basique d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 dans les livrets bruns originaux de OD&D s'appuie sur Chaimail , le wargame que Gygax avait fait avant D&D. Ce n'est que dans Greyhawk que le syst\u00e8me de combat (avec sensibilit\u00e9 aux armes) se d\u00e9veloppe vraiment. J'ai d'ailleurs traduit les tables principales dans la traduction des pouvoirs psioniques (voir ci-dessous). Ce qui est amusant, c'est de d\u00e9couvrir que certains traits de OD&D sont pr\u00e9sents dans les monstres ou les objets magiques de D&D 5e... Je trouve \u00e7a assez touchant. L'esprit de base de Gygax hante encore des productions qui lui sont de tr\u00e8s loin post\u00e9rieures. Jouer avec les r\u00e8gles avec OD&D # En traduisant les pouvoirs psioniques (et quelques sorts connect\u00e9s), j'ai pu constater que Gygax aimait beaucoup jouer avec les r\u00e8gles, en inventer, les imbriquer, les embo\u00eeter, leur donner une logique propre. Certaines sont de v\u00e9ritables micro-jeux. Bien entendu, \u00e0 ce moment, je ne pense pas que la coh\u00e9rence ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cadet de ses soucis. Et comme OD&D ne propose pas vraiment de monde ( Greyhawk est embryonnaire et Blackmoor est quand m\u00eame un tout petit endroit), les r\u00e8gles compl\u00e8tes donnent la possibilit\u00e9 de mod\u00e9liser les diff\u00e9rents univers de fantasy et d'ouvrir le jeu \u00e0 d'autres perspectives. Cet amour des r\u00e8gles, ces derni\u00e8res ayant toujours des objectifs de simulation, est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, car le syst\u00e8me n'appara\u00eet jamais comme \u00e9tant rigide. Le coup du nombre de niveaux de monstres, par exemple, est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, le groupe d'opposants \u00e9tant vus comme une entit\u00e9 globale au travers du nombre de d\u00e9s de dommages que le groupe peut encaisser. Chaque sort, chaque pouvoir psionique peut devenir un mini-syst\u00e8me dans lequel le niveau de ma\u00eetrise (encore un concept int\u00e9ressant) intervient. Dans une mise en page hyper-compacte, l'inventivit\u00e9 est remarquable et il faut se pencher profond\u00e9ment dans les r\u00e8gles pour comprendre toutes les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences que ces derni\u00e8res font entre elles. Evidemment, il est fort possible que toutes ces r\u00e8gles n'aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \"play-test\u00e9es\" pendant des mois, mais soient le fruit d'une logique de semi-improvisation en mode \"homebrew\" (faites \u00e0 la maison). On est loin des jeux modernes ultra-optimis\u00e9s et ultra \u00e9quilibr\u00e9s dont D&D 4e est sans doute l'un des plus beaux repr\u00e9sentants. Le courant OSR # Evidemment, cela explique le courant OSR, tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9crit par Matthew Finch, l'auteur de Swords and Wizardry , dans son papier A Quick Primer for Old School Gaming : Des r\u00e8gles simples, De l'improvisation des joueurs et du MD qui ne passent pas leur temps \u00e0 regarder ce que leur personnage est capable de faire, mais qui le font, le plus souvent sans jet de d\u00e9s, Du fun et du rythme. Je reviendrai sur Finch et sur ses versions de Swords & Wizardry . Publication par WotC du SRD 5.1 en fran\u00e7ais # H\u00e9 oui, le voil\u00e0 : la page sur D&D Beyond et le SRD en question : https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/dnd/SRD_CC_v5.1_FR.pdf sous licence Creative Commons. Cela ne remet pas en cause le travail d'\u00e9quipes comme celles de aidedd.org (qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 traduit le SRD) ou du la Forge de Papier ou du Donjon du Dragon mais cela montre aussi que la France est un march\u00e9 dont WotC devrait s'occuper un peu plus. Des sites en fran\u00e7ais au contenu exceptionnel # C'est vrai que ces trois sites offrent un contenu assez exceptionnel en fran\u00e7ais et on voit que nous avons des amoureux de D&D \u00e0 la manoeuvre. aidedd.org est centr\u00e9 sur D&D 5e et propose plein de mat\u00e9riel fruit des diff\u00e9rentes publications libres en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais de WotC ; la Forge de Papier est centr\u00e9 sur D&D BX, mais propose aussi d'autres choses ; le Donjon du Dragon travaille un peu sur toutes les versions D&D jusqu'\u00e0 AD&D 2e. Je ne sais pas s'il existe des sites francophones sur la 3.X ou sur la 4e (tr\u00e8s d\u00e9cri\u00e9e) mais pour le moment, avec ces trois sites, vous devriez avoir de quoi faire. Glossaire et Open5e # Je viens de cr\u00e9er un repo Git pour mettre sous forme structur\u00e9e le glossaire de traduction anglais-fran\u00e7ais de D&D. Cette t\u00e2che est immense et probablement, ce ne sera probablement qu'une tentative que je ne pourrai pas terminer mais je pense que ce glossaire devrait \u00eatre open source et en donn\u00e9es structur\u00e9es, par exemple pour pouvoir \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 par des sites de VTT, ou en compl\u00e9ment avec des initiatives telles que https://open5e.com de mettre tout ce qui est disponible en SRD, en OGL et en CC4 en donn\u00e9es structur\u00e9es. Open5e est une initiative tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante, m\u00eame si elle est \u00e0 la fois complexe (trouver la bonne structuration des donn\u00e9es) et tr\u00e8s consommatrice en temps. Avoir tout le SRD D&D 5e, et d'autres SRDs, en format json est un d\u00e9fi. A voir ce que \u00e7a va donner. Il n'emp\u00eache que de disposer d'un glossaire global D&D anglais fran\u00e7ais ne serait pas du luxe. En attendant, j'ai agglom\u00e9r\u00e9 les deux glossaires D&D que j'ai trouv\u00e9s (3.5e des anciennes \u00e9ditions Asmod\u00e9e sur archive.org ) et celui de AideDD.org pour la 5e dans un seul PDF disponible ici . 15 ao\u00fbt 2023 Les pouvoirs psioniques de OD&D # J'\u00e9tais en train de chercher \u00e0 comprendre les pouvoirs psioniques de OD&D dans le Suppl\u00e9ment III de OD&D Eldritch Wizardry, quand j'ai voulu en faire une simplification. En ces pages, j'ai fait une premi\u00e8re version tr\u00e8s incompl\u00e8te de la simplification du jeu, puis je me suis dit qu'il fallait faire \u00e7a s\u00e9rieusement. Mais faire une r\u00e9interpr\u00e9tation du jeu sans l'avoir traduit au pr\u00e9alable m'a sembl\u00e9 un peu \u00e9trange. J'ai donc traduit la partie psionique, ajout\u00e9 les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences que cette partie fait aux autres parties de D&D et propos\u00e9 une r\u00e9interpr\u00e9tation des r\u00e8gles. Vous pouvez trouvez dans la zone t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement le PDF. 15 ao\u00fbt 2023 Space Opera et les pouvoirs psionics # En cherchant dans les anc\u00eatres du JDR, j'ai rouvert un vieux PDF de Space Opera de 1984, et l\u00e0 surprise devant l'\u00e9tendue de la partie sur les pouvoirs psioniques. Ces pouvoirs sont bien class\u00e9s par cat\u00e9gorie et ils ne peuvent s'acqu\u00e9rir que progressivement, les uns apr\u00e8s les autres. Pour N\u00e9oMega, on voit que Personality Transfer est le pouvoir num\u00e9ro 22 de la cat\u00e9gorie T\u00e9l\u00e9pathie (pouvoir de niveau 7). En d'autres termes, dans le monde de Space Opera , les M\u00e9gas d'autrefois devraient poss\u00e9der les 21 pouvoirs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pour pourvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du transfert, transfert d'ailleurs qualifi\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s dangereux. J'ai toujours trouv\u00e9 que ce pouvoir avait un c\u00f4t\u00e9 excessif. D\u00e8s lors que l'on peut se transf\u00e9rer facilement dans le super m\u00e9chant, il faut faire attention \u00e0 ce que le pouvoir ne ruine pas le sc\u00e9nario. 18 juin 2023 Des arriv\u00e9es # D&D 4e # Je compl\u00e8te mes bouquins de base de D&D 4e en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais. Oui, je sais, j'arrive apr\u00e8s la bataille mais on fait ce qu'on peut. J'aimerais bien chopper le Handbook 3 qui propose les classes de persos ayant des psioniques. Pouvoirs psychiques # Pour le coup, je pense avoir fait une bonne affaire en d\u00e9gottant une version neuve du Complete Psionics Handbook . C'est un peu un classique. D\u00e9j\u00e0, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de AD&D 1e, Gygax avait fait une synth\u00e8se des psioniques \u00e0 la fin du PHB, un truc un peu compress\u00e9. J'en parlerai peut-\u00eatre dans mon article sur le sujet . Kezaco Savage Worlds # Sinon, dans les trucs divers, j'ai chopp\u00e9 une version ancienne de Savage Worlds , la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition je pense. Je ne me suis pas encore int\u00e9ress\u00e9 au syst\u00e8me. Je ferai \u00e7a un de ces jours. En tous cas, le format est agr\u00e9able. Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Lulu # Sinon, j'ai re\u00e7u de Lulu les deux Anashiva Reahna qui me manquaient en reprint, la Mangoranii et l' Art de la Guerre . Je pense avoir grosso modo les trucs publi\u00e9s Par Durand-Peyrolles sur Empires & Dynasties . Une interview de Croc # J'ai \u00e9cout\u00e9 une petite interview r\u00e9cente de Croc sur Youtube. Marrant qu'il soit toujours dans le circuit et toujours fid\u00e8le \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame. Je l'ai crois\u00e9 lors d'une semaine de jeux \u00e0 Morestel en 1987 ou 1988 sans doute, un truc organis\u00e9 par le Dragon Radieux , Paul et Pascaline Chion. Je me souviens d'un Blood Bowl grandeur nature... Tout \u00e7a ne nous rajeunit pas. A l'\u00e9poque, nous avions jou\u00e9 \u00e0 L\u00e9gendes , \u00e0 Empires & Dynasties , avec Patrick Durand-Peyrolles himself, et \u00e0 R\u00eave de Dragon avec Denis Gerfaud himself. J'en ai gard\u00e9 un vrai d\u00e9go\u00fbt pour L\u00e9gendes o\u00f9 nous avons jou\u00e9 pendant 3h30 un combat de 1 minute ! En une apr\u00e8s-midi, nous avons fait quelques m\u00e8tres en dehors du village celte pour se faire attaquer et... c'est tout ! C'est affligeant et pas ma fa\u00e7on de faire du JDR (voir mes autres articles sur le sujet). Croc a parl\u00e9 du fait qu'il \u00e9tait impatient dans les jeux et qu'il ma\u00eetrisait le syst\u00e8me de jeu parfaitement pour ne pas avoir \u00e0 ouvrir un livre durant le jeu. Je comprends cela. Il faut que la partie m\u00e9canique aille vite. Si les joueurs prennent de temps \u00e0 discuter pendant les phases d'enqu\u00eates, c'est normal, mais la partie combat doit d\u00e9poter. Il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la dualit\u00e9 de la sc\u00e8ne ind\u00e9pendante internationale et fran\u00e7aise du JDR avec, \u00e0 la fois, des m\u00e9caniques de jeu tr\u00e8s innovantes et des univers pas tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9atifs. J'avoue que je suis d'accord avec cette analyse, moi qui revient dans ce monde de nombreuses ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l'avoir quitt\u00e9. Il d\u00e9plore que le monde du JDR n'ait pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 plus de Campagne Imp\u00e9riale que cela, et je suis bien d'accord. J'ai une petite exp\u00e9rience des jeux \u00e9crits par Croc, jeux, qui g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, ne m'ont pas compl\u00e8tement enthousiasm\u00e9 : J'ai fait jouer Bitume , mais je ne suis pas fan ; J'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Magnas Veritas , mais je n'ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 emball\u00e9 ; J'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Bloodlust et j'ai bien aim\u00e9 le coup des armes poss\u00e9d\u00e9es ; \u00e7a fait un peu Stormbringer g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 dans le monde de Warhammer ; mais je pense que c'est un peu trop dark pour moi. Dans les jeux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s, peut-\u00eatre que Scales est celui qui m'int\u00e9resserait le plus. Je ne sais pas si on peut encore trouv\u00e9 le bouquin. NeoMega # Voil\u00e0, je continue \u00e0 travailler \u00e9pisodiquement sur NeoMega , notamment sur un nouveau sc\u00e9nario qui se situe avant le Grand Isolement . 11 juin 2023 Un petit tour des pouvoirs psy (\"psionics\") # J'ai toujours beaucoup plus aim\u00e9 les pouvoirs psy que la magie, m\u00eame si les magies de Cthulhu ou de Stormbringer me plaisaient bien parce qu'elles \u00e9taient soit r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux m\u00e9chants, soit tellement dangereuses que leur utilisation \u00e9tait peu recommand\u00e9e si l'on voulait vivre. La magie de base dans la plupart des jeux de r\u00f4les ne me plaisait pas tellement : la magie ouvrait souvent sur de nombreux sous-syst\u00e8mes peu coh\u00e9rents dans l'univers. Mais \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion, peut-\u00eatre \u00e9tait-ce la mani\u00e8re d'exercer la magie qui ne me plaisait pas trop chez les joueurs : une fa\u00e7on m\u00e9canique un peu bourrine, et justement, d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de magie. J'ai achet\u00e9 des vieux Ars Magica voil\u00e0 quelques temps et je dois dire que j'aime bien, m\u00eame s'il faudrait que j'investisse un peu plus de temps dans le jeu. J'ai un peu l'impression que Ars Magica est le Hurlements que nous aurions d\u00fb avoir, mais c'est un autre d\u00e9bat. D'ailleurs, \u00e7a ma fait penser que je dois mettre en ligne un \u00e9dito de Paul Chion, l'ancien r\u00e9dacteur en chef de Dragon Radieux sur le JDR fran\u00e7ais. C'est tr\u00e8s amusant avec le recul. Sans doute aussi suis-je un enfant de M\u00e9ga 2 et non de D&D . J'ai pourtant eu D&D avant, mais sans y joueur pendant tr\u00e8s longtemps, n'\u00e9tant pas un grand adepte du dungeon crawling. Toujours est-il que ce tour des pouvoirs psy d\u00e9marre par Eldritch Wizardry de D&D 0e . Autant vous pr\u00e9venir, il faut \u00eatre motiv\u00e9 pour comprendre ce machin : c'est un capharna\u00fcm inf\u00e2me de r\u00e8gles psioniques m\u00eal\u00e9es avec des r\u00e8gles sur le druide et autres suppl\u00e9ments. Franchement, je pense que c'est un des pires modules de tout les temps, sachant que, dans la partie psioniques, des tables cit\u00e9es plusieurs fois manquent ! Je vais donc l'\u00e9lire : Grand prix de la pire \u00e9dition dans le monde du JDR ! Toujours est-il que j'ai d\u00e9marr\u00e9 une page sur le sujet : pouvoirs psychiques dans le JDR . C'est un \"work in progress\". En fait, je le fais un peu parce que j'aime bien l'arch\u00e9ologie, et aussi un peu pour NeoMega , o\u00f9 les pouvoirs psy sont centraux \u00e0 l'univers mais avec beaucoup de limitations. 3 juin 2023 R\u00e9alisations et investigations # R\u00e9alisations # Commen\u00e7ons par les r\u00e9alisations : le sc\u00e9nario pour Troika! est quasiment termin\u00e9. Il manque la table des rencontres plus une ou deux relectures pour les d\u00e9tails et la coh\u00e9rence. J'ai pas mal h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 sortir le bouquin comme \u00e7a. Je voulais rajouter quelques sorts qui ne figuraient pas dans le livre original. En format A4, on est d\u00e9j\u00e0 au del\u00e0 des 130 pages. J'ai peur qu'avec NeoMega! , le livre ne devienne plus \u00e9pais encore, surtout avec la campagne qui va avec. Je suis assez partag\u00e9. Pour ce qui est de NeoMega, j'ai pas mal travaill\u00e9 les pouvoirs psy qui \u00e9taient utiles dans cette version. Je ne souhaite pas rentrer tout de suite dans les catalogues comme on les trouve dans les autres JDR. J'ai consult\u00e9 GURPS Psionics et c'est bien fait, beaucoup plus complexe que ce dont j'ai besoin. Je suis en train de regarder le Psionic Power de D&D 4e mais il faut que je r\u00e9cup\u00e8re les bases du jeu avant de me lancer dans cette lecture. On y trouve des classes de personnages utilisant les pouvoirs psychiques (je n'aime pas dire \"psioniques\", je ne sais pas pourquoi). Investigations sur D&D 4e # Bon, inutile de rappeler que cette \u00e9dition fut la plus controvers\u00e9e de toutes les \u00e9ditions de D&D. Le choc a \u00e9t\u00e9 fort sur toute la communaut\u00e9, notamment au niveau du syst\u00e8me de jeu, que l'on a tax\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re un peu facile, de s'inspirer des jeux de r\u00f4les en ligne. La gen\u00e8se de D&D 4e # En fait, je conseille la lecture de Wizzards Presents Races and Classes qui retrace, vu de l'int\u00e9rieur, la gen\u00e8se de D&D 4e. C'est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant. La feuille de route de Bill Slavicsek de mai 2005 donne le ton avec des buts de conception du jeu (je traduis ses 8 demandes au groupe de designers). 1. Le jeu doit \u00eatre un jeu de r\u00f4les m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique Cela reste DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, et nous devons rester fid\u00e8les \u00e0 nos racines. 2. Le Dungeon Master comme Storyteller Nous avons discut\u00e9 de l'impasse du DM comme opposant aux joueurs, et donc nous croyons que le DM comme Storyteller est un concept plus fort et mieux adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 notre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle. 3. Une exp\u00e9rience de jeu coop\u00e9ratif De m\u00eame, nous voulons maintenir l'aspect coop\u00e9ratif et \u00e9quipe des groupes d'aventuriers. 4. M\u00e9caniques de base Il faut garder le d20, les jets \u00e9lev\u00e9s indiquant un bon r\u00e9sultat, les classes, les niveaux, et les races fantastiques. Il faut que le jeu reste unifi\u00e9 et solide dans ses m\u00e9caniques, et il faut suivre cette voie dans tous ses aspects. 5. Des tactiques tridimensionnelles Nous voulons continuer d'utiliser des figurines localis\u00e9es dans des carr\u00e9s de 1.5 m\u00e8tre (\"5-foot squares\"). Nous voulons concevoir des mini-jeux (escarmouche) pour fonctionner avec le JDR. Nous en reparlerons prochainement. 6. Des options et non pas des restrictions Nous voulons maintenir cette philosophie dans la nouvelle \u00e9dition, m\u00eame si nous entrevoyons des endroits dans le jeu o\u00f9 nous voudrions mettre en place quelques restrictions pour l'\u00e9quilibre du jeu. 7. Am\u00e9liorer le jeu Pour bien pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle \u00e9dition au public, nous devons cr\u00e9er un meilleur jeu, plus rapide et plus robuste. Les am\u00e9liorations devraient inclure quelque chose de cool \u00e0 chaque niveau, plus de place \u00e0 la conception pour les options des personnages (mais attention \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9), un meilleur m\u00e9lange de m\u00e9caniques (\"crunch\") et d'histoire ou d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de roleplay (\"fluff\"). Supprimer les r\u00e8gles, les sorts et les sous-syst\u00e8mes probl\u00e9matiques. 8. Faire un jeu facile \u00e0 concevoir, \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper, \u00e0 \u00e9diter D&D 3.0/3.5 est un monstre dans lequel il est tr\u00e8s difficile de construire, depuis les blocs de statistiques jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9quilibre des rencontres. Corrigeons ce probl\u00e8me une fois pour toutes et rendons facile la cr\u00e9ation de produits dans le futur. Si nous pouvions passer moins de temps sur les d\u00e9tails et plus sur le facteur facilit\u00e9 pour les conceptions futures, nous serions tous gagnants. Qu'est-ce qu'un jeu extensible ? # Donc, force est de constater que l'\u00e9quipe de conception du jeu a suivi les recommandations, notamment la derni\u00e8re qui est fondamentale : pour qu'un jeu soit extensible, il faut qu'il propose une certaine \"horizontalit\u00e9\", soit des principes fondateurs sur lesquels il est possible de b\u00e2tir facilement aujourd'hui comme demain. Les jeux qui complexifient le syst\u00e8me et le verrouillent rendent complexes toutes les \u00e9volutions. \u00c9videmment, les am\u00e9ricains y voient un probl\u00e8me financier, mais le probl\u00e8me est, comme le dit Slavicsek, avant tout un probl\u00e8me de conception. Si je voulais \u00eatre ironique, je dirais que le point 8 pourrait se r\u00e9sumer \u00e0 : comment D&D 4 devient aussi souple que GURPS Core System ? Une des premi\u00e8res choses que l'on apprend dans le Races & Classes , c'est que le d\u00e9fi est relev\u00e9 au travers des sources de pouvoirs (\"power sources\"). Dans la mesure o\u00f9 chaque classe peut tirer de sa propre source de pouvoir ses pouvoirs, le syst\u00e8me remplit sa promesse de pouvoir \u00eatre extensible \u00e0 l'infini : les sources de pouvoirs \"g\u00e9n\u00e8rent\" des diff\u00e9rentes classes (et il sera donc possible d'en cr\u00e9er de nouvelles dans le futur). Il reste toujours possible de sp\u00e9cialiser \"en profondeur\" les classes, mais \"verticalement, sans impacter les autres classes, car n'ayant pas la m\u00eame source de pouvoirs, elles ne sont pas \"en collision\" ou en risque d'incoh\u00e9rence. Bien s\u00fbr, cela implique que le guerrier a une structure de pouvoirs qui est la m\u00eame que celle des magiciens et aux clercs , m\u00eame si son pouvoir est \"martial\", alors que les autres sont respectivement \"arcanes\" ou \"divins\". Ainsi, une source de pouvoirs \"psionic\" est envisageable \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des autres (cf. Player's Guide volume 2 ). A chacun sa source de pouvoirs ! Ce choix de conception a de multiples avantages : Chaque niveau de personnage peut \u00eatre \"tun\u00e9\" aux petits oignons, et donc \u00eatre \"cool \u00e0 passer (besoin num\u00e9ro 7 de Slavicsek). Comme l'\u00e9chelle de tous les pouvoirs est absolue (en gros chaque pouvoir est d\u00e9crit de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on sur une \u00e9chelle universelle), les diff\u00e9rentes classes de personnages sont comparables en puissance ! D'o\u00f9 il s'en suit que le jeu peut \u00eatre \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 parce qu'au final, tout en \u00e9tant dans des \"espaces de pouvoirs\" diff\u00e9rents, les diff\u00e9rentes classes peuvent se comparer les unes aux autres et peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es les unes sur les autres. Je voudrais r\u00e9sumer ces choix de conception par le diagramme suivant : Le mod\u00e8le est bi-dimensionnel : Chaque source de pouvoir (par exemple A) peut abriter plusieurs classes qui ne sont pas toutes d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es (par exemple A2) ; Il est possible d'ajouter des sources de pouvoirs pour cr\u00e9er de nouvelles classes ; Dans le futur, il ne sera pas plus difficile qu'aujourd'hui de cr\u00e9er de nouvelles classes au travers de nouvelles sources de pouvoirs (par exemple D). On peut dire que la conception du mod\u00e8le est plut\u00f4t bien faite, surtout si l'on envisage un monde avec diff\u00e9rents formes de magie. D'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, le syst\u00e8me de classes et de niveaux est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9, et de l'autre, il est extensible \"horizontalement\" (on dirait vraiment qu'on parle de software parfois). D&D 4e, copi\u00e9 sur les jeux vid\u00e9os ? # Il est possible que le syst\u00e8me soit copi\u00e9 sur les jeux massivement multijoueurs mais ce n'est pas \u00e9vident au premier abord. Rodney Thompson, dans le Races and Classes , indique qu'une des grandes inspirations de D&D 4e est Star Wars d20 Saga Edition . Haha, on rigole bien fort quand on sait que le lead designer de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition de Star Wars d20 n'est autre que... ... Bill Slavicsek lui-m\u00eame ! On n'est jamais mieux servi que par soi-m\u00eame ! En gros, huit ans apr\u00e8s avoir fait lui-m\u00eame le travail, Slavicsek envoie le message suivant : je me suis fait chier \u00e0 adapter le syst\u00e8me d20 \u00e0 l'univers de Star Wars, donc les petits amis, prenez-en de la graine pour D&D 4e ! En tous cas, j'avoue que cette lecture est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante et que je suis tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9ablement surpris par ce syst\u00e8me de jeu. On a souvent dit que le jeu serait sorti sous n'importe quel autre nom, il aurait fait un buzz du tonnerre et c'est sans doute vrai. Parce que le jeu venait apr\u00e8s D&D 3.5e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conspu\u00e9 un peu rapidement sans doute. Mais j'y reviendrai. D&D 4e, le choc qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 DCC ? # Je vais vous livrer une interpr\u00e9tation personnelle. Le syst\u00e8me d20 appliqu\u00e9 aux univers modernes, \u00e7a faisait tripper pas grand monde dans les ann\u00e9es 2000, parce que cela semblait un choix par d\u00e9faut depuis la faillite de West End Games et donc la disparition du support de Star Wars d6. Mais quand D&D 4e est sorti, le monde de l'OGL, des copies de OD&D/D&D/AD&D/AD&D 2e/D&D 3.0/3.5, s'est pris une grosse baffe dans la t\u00eate ! Car si le jeu a \"d\u00e9plu\" (enfin commercialement je crois que c'est un vrai succ\u00e8s par rapport \u00e0 l'\u00e9dition 3.0/3.5), il a compl\u00e8tement refondu la base de D&D en brisant la plupart des totems ! Je pense que Joseph Goodman, qui faisait alors des sc\u00e9narios pour D&D 3.0/3.5 s'est fait \u00e9lectrocuter (il faut que je recherche des interviews de lui \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque) ! Alors que des milliers de joueurs (et Paizo avec Pathfinder ) restaient coinc\u00e9s dans la nostalgie d'une copie litt\u00e9rale d'une des versions du pass\u00e9, Wizzards sortait un jeu qui cassait la baraque, un vrai D&D mais compl\u00e8tement refondu avec un c\u00f4t\u00e9 jeu de plateau tactique super amusant ! Incroyable ! Tout le monde n'a pas compris d'ailleurs, \u00e0 commencer par Paizo, tellement la refonte et la pulv\u00e9risation des tabous Gygaxiens a \u00e9t\u00e9 forte ! Un D&D coh\u00e9rent, amusant, \u00e0 la m\u00e9canique bien huil\u00e9e, r\u00e9inventant tous les univers du ma\u00eetre Gygax mais en voulant \u00eatre jouable : Forgotten Realms : mouais pas le plus r\u00e9ussi ; Dark Sun : on dirait que D&D 4e a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour Dark Sun, Les manuels sur les plans sont totalement refondus pour devenir jouables, Les autres, je connais trop peu. Pour moi, Goodman s'est dit : \" D&D 4e a bris\u00e9 tous les tabous. Qu'est-ce que je voudrais mettre dans mon OGL ? Un peu de Cthulhu, un peu de Stormbringer avec les effets retour de la magie quand elle rate, un peu de OD&D, un peu de fantasy genre l' appendix N de AD&D . H\u00e9 voil\u00e0 ! Je peux faire de l'OGL perso, sans me prendre les foudres de tous les extr\u00e9mistes : ils s'acharnent sur D&D 4e ! Quelle bonne aubaine !\" C'est devenu DCC . Mais, finalement, ce jeu super innovant n'est qu'OGL lib\u00e9r\u00e9, d\u00e9complex\u00e9, apr\u00e8s D&D 4e qui casse la baraque de Gygax et reconstruit un immeuble \u00e0 la place ! Des faits, rien que des faits # Bon, stoppons-l\u00e0 les suppositions. Je poursuis ma lecture du Races and Classes et je vais peut-\u00eatre apprendre encore des choses. Je vous dirai. R\u00eave de Dragon (1985) # J'ai retrouv\u00e9 une vieille copie de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, mais alors en mauvais \u00e9tat. Mais pourquoi, me direz-vous, alors que le jeu est disponible dans sa troisi\u00e8me \u00e9dition sur le site scriptarium.org ? Parce que j'aime bien comprendre les \u00e9volutions du jeu et suivre la chronologie. J'avoue que quand je jeu est sorti en 1985, je n'avais pas l'argent pour l'acheter. En plus, je jouais \u00e0 M\u00e9ga 2 . Je suis donc en train de bouquiner cette premi\u00e8re version pour me faire une id\u00e9e. Le premier sentiment est que le jeu est compliqu\u00e9... Space Opera (1981) # Autre jeu dont j'entendais souvent parler les gens plus \u00e2g\u00e9s autour de moi dans les ann\u00e9es 80 : Space Opera . Ayant appris que le jeu poss\u00e9dait des r\u00e8gles pour les pouvoirs psy, je me dis que cela valait le coup de lire le Core Manual. C'est dans ma to-do list. C'est marrant, je ne me souviens pas de pouvoirs psy dans Traveller . Mais je connais mal le jeu aussi. 21 mai 2023 Plein de choses # Bon, ce blog n'est pas tr\u00e8s vivant. Faisons un petit bilan des derni\u00e8res nouvelles. Troika!NeoMega! # Je suis toujours en train de travailler sur ce projet. J'ai fait un petit update sur itch.io , mais c'est un gros travail si l'on veut faire un produit pas trop pourri. L\u00e0, je finalise le premier sc\u00e9nario, celui de Troika! Puis je passerai \u00e0 la partie NeoMega! On ne se rend pas compte du temps que tout cela peut prendre lorsque l'on fait tout, \u00e9criture, mise en page, illustrations, cartes ! Cela me fait comprendre toute la machinerie derri\u00e8re de beaux projets comme Call of Cthulhu 7e. Call of Cthulhu # Parlons-en de CoC. J'ai fini l'\u00e9tat des lieux des suppl\u00e9ments en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Puis j'ai achet\u00e9 en ligne des versions anciennes de la cinqui\u00e8me et de la sixi\u00e8me \u00e9dition en anglais. J'ai d\u00e9couvert la septi\u00e8me \u00e9dition qui est une belle production, sortant un peu des deux colonnes en noir et blanc, m\u00eame si ces pr\u00e9sentations ont leur charme. CoC est vraiment un jeu qui me correspond, et cela depuis toujours. Les enqu\u00eates, le syst\u00e8me de combat et de magie qu'il vaut mieux \u00e9viter si l'on ne veut pas mourir trop vite, de nombreux PNJ, c'est ma vision du JDR. Pour le moment, je lis la cinqui\u00e8me \u00e9dition en anglais. Truc marrant : j'ai acquis r\u00e9cemment un vieux jeu fran\u00e7ais (j'y reviendrai), et le vendeur m'a envoy\u00e9 un num\u00e9ro r\u00e9cent de Architeutis parlant de la faillite de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Sans D\u00e9tour , \u00e9ditrice en fran\u00e7ais de la sixi\u00e8me \u00e9dition de CoC. Bon, soyons francs : je n'ai jamais aim\u00e9 le mise en page de cette sixi\u00e8me \u00e9dition fran\u00e7aise, et old school que je suis, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re les vieux produits Jeux Descartes . C'est un jeu que j'ach\u00e8te et non une \u0153uvre d'art ! Concernant CoC sixi\u00e8me \u00e9dition, je n'ai pas eu le temps d'investiguer. J'ai relu la nouvelle The Call of Cthulhu en introduction, mais je ne suis pas all\u00e9 plus loin. Enfin, je pr\u00e9vois de virer toutes mes vieilles photocopies d'antan et de les remplacer par des prints Lulu prochainement. Quel merveilleux jeu ! En ce qui concerne la septi\u00e8me \u00e9dition, je n'y suis pas encore : je rattrape mon retard. Je n'aime pas trop les caract\u00e9ristiques des PJs en pourcentages... je ne vois pas d'o\u00f9 \u00e7a sort (\u00e0 part virer la table de r\u00e9sistance). Mouais, je verrai \u00e7a plus tard. Finissons d'abord la 5e et on verra ensuite. CoC, un jeu vivant depuis 1981 ! # Je vais en profiter pour faire un peu de provocation : j'ai achet\u00e9 ma premi\u00e8re version de l' Appel de Cthulhu vers 1983 (seconde \u00e9dition) et depuis, le jeu est maintenu ! Quel jeu fran\u00e7ais b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'un tel support, d'\u00e9ditions successives et de qualit\u00e9 dans les contenus ? Hein ? Parce que c'est facile de sortir un jeu et puis de laisser tomber vos joueurs. C'est, je crois la grande diff\u00e9rence entre les am\u00e9ricains et nous : nous avons plein d' \u00e9gos pour faire des jeux (comme si la m\u00e9canique de jeux \u00e9tait un probl\u00e8me) mais pas des masses de gens pour soutenir le jeu sur le long terme (sc\u00e9narios, extensions). C'est notre c\u00f4t\u00e9 proc\u00e9durier, administratif \u00e0 nous les fran\u00e7ais : on adore les lois, des tonnes de lois et de r\u00e8glements qui tuent tout et paralysent tout. Et le jeu de r\u00f4les en est une illustration un peu affligeante, je l'avoue. Par exemple, un jeu comme R\u00eave de Dragon aurait d\u00fb cartonner depuis des d\u00e9cennies en France. Mais bon, quand on regarde les r\u00e8gles, on est vraiment calm\u00e9. C'est comme jouer \u00e0 Rolemaster. C'est sympa mais le c\u00f4t\u00e9 ultra-sp\u00e9cifique et ultra-crunchy est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s dur pour un produit : c'est comme des boulets que l'on porte. Il est difficile pour les autres de faire des sc\u00e9narios pour votre jeu et il est difficile pour vos MJs d'\u00e9voluer sans vous derri\u00e8re. C'est ce qu'on pourrait appeler des impasses... Compl\u00e9tion de D&D 4e en anglais # Un d\u00e9tail : il me manquait le Monster Manual de D&D 4e. C'est maintenant chose faite (j'ai chopp\u00e9 un vieux machin pas trop usag\u00e9). Marrant comme cette \u00e9dition ressemble une BD... Je n'ai pas encore creus\u00e9 pourquoi le syst\u00e8me de jeu avait tant d\u00e9fray\u00e9 la chronique. GURPS 3e # H\u00e9 oui, j'ai craqu\u00e9. Je n'avais jamais lu les r\u00e8gles de GURPS en mode papier, et j'ai eu une bonne occasion sur la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9dition en anglais. En fait, je cherche des syst\u00e8mes de pouvoirs qui me fassent tripper et donc je commence par les grands classiques. Et l\u00e0, j'avoue que c'est pas mal. J'aime bien : La m\u00e9canique \u00e0 deux niveaux : vous avez un score dans le pouvoir et une comp\u00e9tence dans le pouvoir psy qui y est rattach\u00e9 ; La couverture des pouvoirs psy et leur classification ; Les m\u00e9canismes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 (une genre de mode \"boost\") mais qui \u00e9puisent le personnage. Un must. J'ai un peu regard\u00e9 le suppl\u00e9ment sur les pouvoirs psioniques. Et \u00e7a me para\u00eet \u00eatre un bon suppl\u00e9ment. Il faut que je me le procure pour creuser un peu. Tout cela, c'est dans le cadre de NeoMega . J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 une liste de pouvoirs psy, mais je suis tr\u00e8s ouvert \u00e0 des ouvrages de gens ayant pass\u00e9 beaucoup plus de temps que moi sur le sujet. La Forge de Papier / le Donjon du Dragon # Bon, ben l\u00e0, je pense qu'il faut r\u00e9aliser que nous avons des fous furieux passionn\u00e9s par D&D, B/X en particulier. J'avoue que je lis tout, je t\u00e9l\u00e9charge tout et je suis super content que des gens comme \u00e7a existent. Je pense qu'ils m'ont fait comprendre D&D apr\u00e8s toutes ces ann\u00e9es. Encore une fois, pour les fans de D&D old school : La Forge de Papier . Bon, l\u00e0 aussi, force est de constater que ces gens ne sont pas sains d'esprit ! Ils ont abus\u00e9 de D&D et ont d\u00fb perdre quelques points de SAN (c'est certain que les D&D guyz sont mauvais en jet de 1D100 sous la SAN, car tout ce qui n'est pas D20...) pour vouloir traduire tous les suppl\u00e9ments de l'univers que TSR a un jour produits (314 containers \u00e9quivalent vingt-pieds selon mes estimations). Le lien : Donjon du Dragon . D'ailleurs, je viens de demander \u00e0 Lulu de m'imprimer D&D 0e (les trois livrets bruns traduits par le Donjon du Dragon). Par contre, guys, je les ai imprim\u00e9s en US Letter, parce qu'\u00e0 mon grand \u00e2ge, des pages denses en A5, c'est compliqu\u00e9. Tourisme en Italie et BRP # A l'occasion d'un peu de tourisme en Italie, j'ai fait l'acquisition de la derni\u00e8re mouture de Magic World , de Chaosium. Comment dire, je suis un peu d\u00e9\u00e7u. Je ne pensais pas acheter une version de BRP avec un saupoudrage de magie. Pas du tout d'inventivit\u00e9 dans la magie... On dirait un vrai sous-produit. Runequest est bien plus complet en fait. D'ailleurs, apr\u00e8s m'\u00eatre fait voir, je suis all\u00e9 sur le site de Chaosium pour voir que le produit n'\u00e9tait m\u00eame plus market\u00e9 (il reste en vente en PDF sur DriveThru ). Bref, ne pas acheter, surtout si on conna\u00eet les autres produits BRP . Au fait, la derni\u00e8re \u00e9dition de BRP vient de sortir en PDF. J'attends la finalisation de la licence ORC qui devrait d\u00e9coincer un peu la licence third-party BRP . Je l'avais regard\u00e9e mais elle est trop contraignante. Esp\u00e9rons que ORC changera la donne. Moment nostalgie : Stormbringer # Enfin, cet achat inopportun aura eu la vertu de me faire rouvrir un vieux classeur avec une vieille copie de la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9dition de Stormbringer en fran\u00e7ais datant de Mathusalem. En cherchant une version PDF de ce jeu que j'ai perdu il y a bien longtemps, j'ai trouv\u00e9 ce site, elric.melnibonee.free.fr , site sur lequel vous pourrez trouver les PDF des deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9ditions fran\u00e7aises. \u00c9videmment, l\u00e0, la magie est d'un autre niveau. Mais c'est gr\u00e2ce, je pense, \u00e0 la plume de Ken St-Andr\u00e9, l'inventeur de Tunnels & Trolls , un fin connaisseur de l'\u0153uvre de Moorcock. J'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Lulu de me r\u00e9imprimer la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, ce qui est un mauvais plan car j'ai toujours un gros classeur avec la copie de la seconde \u00e9dition que je ne vis pas pouvoir bazarder... Les sites d'occasions # C'est vrai qu'en France, nous pouvons trouver pas mal d'occasions sur divers sites : eBay : pas mal de chose, mais c'est souvent assez cher. Mais bon, j'ai trouv\u00e9 pas mal de choses int\u00e9ressantes. Rakuten : j'ai trouv\u00e9 pas mal de choses sur Rakuten. J'aime bien m\u00eame si le site est un peu nase (recherches impossibles en multipages dans le boutiques). Le Bon Coin : je d\u00e9couvre. Jamais utilis\u00e9 mais pas mal de gens ont plein de choses \u00e0 vendre. Abebooks : pour les livres anciens. On ne trouve pas souvent des choses, et elles sont souvent ch\u00e8res, mais parfois, on peut trouver des choses int\u00e9ressantes. Sinon, j'ach\u00e8te assez peu de neuf, sauf en PDF sur drivethru , et encore, c'est pour faire imprimer par Lulu . Le probl\u00e8me de Lulu, c'est que c'est long ! Je voyais une australienne l'autre fois sur Internet qui disait que, pour vendre son bouquin, elle passait par Amazon KDP parce que c'\u00e9tait beaucoup plus rapide. Je la crois. Pas possible de vendre un bouquin \u00e0 des clients sur Lulu tellement c'est long. Pour autant, l'impression est faite en France et est de bonne qualit\u00e9. Donc, parfait pour un usage personnel. Quelques d\u00e9couvertes # A l'occasion de ma commande sur Le plumier des Chim\u00e8res d'un vieux jeu fran\u00e7ais auquel j'ai un peu jou\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9, Empires et Dynasties , j'ai re\u00e7u dans mon paquet quelques petits cadeaux (merci Philippe Jaillet, responsable des jeux Posidonia). Une remarque pr\u00e9alable de la part de celui qui travaille sur un reboot de \" Mega \" ( NeoMega ), la production est tr\u00e8s belle et tr\u00e8s travaill\u00e9e. On voit un vrai travail qui ne ferait pas rougir un \u00e9diteur am\u00e9ricain. Mais... Ce qui va suivre n'engage que moi mais il y a un gros \"mais\". Emysfer est un monde int\u00e9ressant. On a envie d'y jouer, vraiment. Les descriptions des diff\u00e9rentes races sont sympas, inventives, amusantes et l'on imagine bien ce que l'on peut vivre \u00e0 la table de jeu. En ce qui concerne les Les terres de Matnak , c'est pareil : la bestialit\u00e9 dans les humains, le fait de lutter contre, tout \u00e7a, c'est super, comme univers. La mal\u00e9diction des jeux fran\u00e7ais # Venons-en au \"mais\". Mais pourquoi inventer des syst\u00e8mes de jeu \"\u00e0 la con\" ? Je suis navr\u00e9 mais il faut que quelqu'un le dise. Ces jeux sont des univers tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressants pour un syst\u00e8me de jeu m\u00e9di\u00e9val fantastique comme D&D , GURPS , BRP Runequest , Warhammer , Troika! , etc. Mais pourquoi r\u00e9inventer un syst\u00e8me de jeu complet ? J'ai vu dans les crit\u00e8res du Graal d'Or \"ad\u00e9quation du syst\u00e8me de jeu avec l'univers\". C'est vraiment horrible : c'est une volont\u00e9, un objectif, de faire des syst\u00e8mes de jeu merdiques, hyper complexes, sp\u00e9cifiques, qui dans deux ans ne seront plus jamais support\u00e9s... J'avoue que j'ai toujours eu du mal \u00e0 comprendre ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne. C\u00f4t\u00e9 syst\u00e8mes de jeux, il existe tellement de choses bien (et \"open source\"). Pour ne citer que les plus connus : D&D , d20 system : avec l' OGL , on peut dire qu'on peut maintenant tordre les r\u00e8gles dans tous les sens avec la b\u00e9n\u00e9diction de Wizards. BRP : avec la nouvelle licence ORC , le syst\u00e8me de jeu va devenir plus facile encore \u00e0 utiliser. GURPS : quand on a lu quelques extensions, on voit comment avoir des mondes avec leurs r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9cifiques dans un univers de jeu connu par les joueurs et les MJs. Fate : dans le genre, j'accommode tout \u00e0 ma sauce, Fate est le bon candidat. d6 system : beaucoup de mat\u00e9riel open source en ligne faciles \u00e0 utiliser. PbtA : Dieu sait que je n'aime pas ce syst\u00e8me de jeu, mais bon, il est utilisable. Les \u00e9diteurs am\u00e9ricains ont fait des efforts ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Et pourquoi ne pas sortir l'univers comme un suppl\u00e9ment \u00e0 divers syst\u00e8mes de jeux ? C'est la m\u00eame question que je posais voil\u00e0 quelques mois : pourquoi les sc\u00e9narios des canards de JDR sont toujours ax\u00e9s sur un jeu et ne proposent pas des d\u00e9clinaisons sur plusieurs moteurs de jeux ? Donc, l\u00e0 Posidonia sort deux super produits avec deux bonnes accroches. Mais comme je n'ai pas beaucoup de temps, ni \u00e0 la table de jeu, ni en mode prep, il me faut quelque chose qui se d\u00e9cline vite sur un syst\u00e8me que je connaisse. Pour les Terres de Matnak , la Bestialit\u00e9 aurait pu ressembler \u00e0 la Sant\u00e9 Mentale de CoC, car techniquement, c'est tr\u00e8s proche. Vu comme \u00e7a, je peux l'int\u00e9grer dans une campagne med-fan BRP. Emysfer est un monde jouable dans plein de jeux, mais ce n'est pas un vrai jeu. Ce n'est pas parce que j'ai un ensemble de comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cifiques que je suis oblig\u00e9 de r\u00e9\u00e9crire le moteur de jeu tout entier ! Car, sur le sujet du syst\u00e8me de jeu, ces deux jeux n'ont rien d'innovant : ils sont tr\u00e8s classiques en d\u00e9finitive (hormis un vocabulaire parfois pompeux plein de \"concepts \u00e0 la con\"). Il reste le sujet d'\"acheter des narrations\", manifestement tr\u00e8s en vogue sur la C\u00f4t\u00e9 d'Azur, un genre de mode participatif des joueurs dans un jeu crunchy... J'avoue que je n'ai pas tellement compris comment \u00e7a marchait. Cela me para\u00eet assez compliqu\u00e9. O\u00f9 est le produit ? # Alors bon, je ne suis qu'un simple utilisateur, ayant pas mal jou\u00e9 et ayant des vell\u00e9it\u00e9s d'adapter (\u00e0 la marge) un jeu super simpliste pour jouer sur le pouce dans un univers que j'aime. Je ne connais pas tout ce que connaissent les gens qui se d\u00e9m\u00e8nent pour crowdfunder les jeux indies fran\u00e7ais. Mais, je pense que nous avons un d\u00e9faut grave de compr\u00e9hension du march\u00e9. Si je veux faire jouer ma table avec des r\u00e8gles \u00e0 moi dans un univers \u00e0 moi, c'est cool, je ne demande rien \u00e0 personne. Mais quand je veux publier, il faut se poser une grande question : le produit va \u00eatre vendu ; est-ce que je veux en vendre ? Parce que, au del\u00e0 d'une niche de gens qui vont permettre au crowdfunding de marcher, est-ce que je veux que le jeu soit encore l\u00e0 dans dix ans ? Est-ce que je ne fais que r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 mon \u00e9go de montrer \u00e0 tous quel concepteur hors pair je suis et \"comme il est bien\" le monde que j'ai invent\u00e9 ? Supposons que Emysfer soit un monde pour D&D 5e : Je peux jouer en France dans ce monde ; Je peux favoriser que des aventures soient faites par d'autres et donc ouvrir une communaut\u00e9 de joueurs ; Je peux le traduire ; Je peux le vendre sur Dungeon Masters Guild ; Dans 3 ans, je peux en faire une seconde \u00e9dition pour D&D 6e. Attention, je ne suis pas un agent de Wizards ! Mais l\u00e0, on tient quelque chose. L'aspect game design reviendrait, dans ce cas, \u00e0 adapter \u00e0 D&D 5e les concepts tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifiques aux monde de Emysfer (la m\u00e9moire surtout). Pareil pour les Terres de Matnak , sachant que le monde pourrait \u00eatre facilement adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 Warhammer. Il faut voir aussi ce qui existe : il serait \u00e9tonnant que AD&D 1e ou Warhammer n'aient pas \u00e9voqu\u00e9 les transformations bestiales des humains. Avec une approche d'extension, id\u00e9alement multi-syst\u00e8me de jeux, le monde peut perdurer. Alors que des gens comme moi n'ont plus envie de lire des bouquins de r\u00e8gles avec plein de trucs bizarres. Par contre, nous sommes consommateurs de mondes (ou de morceaux de mondes) et de sc\u00e9narios \u00e9piques. Ce n'est pas de ma faute si la plupart des moteurs de jeux puissants viennent des US : ils sont six fois plus nombreux que nous, donc tout est plus play-test\u00e9, industrialis\u00e9, peaufin\u00e9, \u00e9dition apr\u00e8s \u00e9dition. Nous, on gal\u00e8re, parce qu'il est tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9 de monter des communaut\u00e9s de JDR chez nous : elles sont hyper fractionn\u00e9es. Et donc, tout le monde tire la langue. Architeuthis # Philippe Jaillet m'a aussi envoy\u00e9 gratuitement le num\u00e9ro 1 d'Architeuthis. D\u00e9j\u00e0, le nom du magazine est compliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 retenir. Dans l'\u00e9dito, il s'y plaint de l'\u00e9tat du march\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais. Je suis d'accord avec lui, mais ce n'est pas en publiant des micro-JDR sans communaut\u00e9 que l'on pourra redresser la barre. Casus Belli avait, dans le temps, tent\u00e9 de surmonter ce probl\u00e8me, d'abord en s'accrochant \u00e0 BRP , puis \u00e0 Simulacres qui est un jeu ultra-merdique. L'id\u00e9e \u00e9tait que chaque sc\u00e9nario pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9clin\u00e9 dans le moteur de jeux g\u00e9n\u00e9rique \"fran\u00e7ais\", bonne id\u00e9e en soi, sauf que je n'ai jamais r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 dig\u00e9rer les \"concepts\" de Simulacres . Il en r\u00e9sulte un probl\u00e8me de fond : nous sommes pilot\u00e9s par les jeux US (oui) et la multitude de jeux fran\u00e7ais atomise le march\u00e9 (oui) avec des prix horribles (oui) et des toutes petites s\u00e9ries (oui). C'est ce que je trouve top avec DCC : m\u00eame prix en euros qu'en dollars : 40\u20ac le jeu et 10 \u20ac les sc\u00e9nars. De belles illustrations en NB par contre, c'est du old school. En comparaison : Laelith la cit\u00e9 : 70\u20ac ; R\u00eave de Dragon + Invitation au Voyage 55\u20ac+55\u20ac ; M\u00e9ga 5 , en rupture de stock aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s sa sortie, aucun suivi commercial ; Mal\u00e9fices , rupture de stock ; etc. Alors, oui, ce sont des \u0153uvres d'art, mais on peut jouer avec ? Et quel suivi ? J'ai achet\u00e9 Empires et Dynasties par nostalgie et parce que j'avais perdu mon exemplaire. Philippe Jaillet en avait un neuf (miracle ?). Ce jeu propose un effort \u00e9norme de description du monde de R\u00e9ah mais, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un succ\u00e8s, parce qu'il cumule deux d\u00e9savantages : un monde complexe et inconnu, compl\u00e8tement li\u00e9 \u00e0 son auteur, et un syst\u00e8me de jeu sp\u00e9cifique (voir mon sujet sur l'accessibilit\u00e9 des JDR ). Jamais personne n'a pu \u00e9crire de suppl\u00e9ments \u00e0 E&D sauf Durand-Peyrolles. Ah, c'est dommage. Mais m\u00eame pour R\u00eave de Dragon , regardez les auteurs des sc\u00e9narios dans les canards de l'\u00e9poque, il se comptent sur les doigts d'une main. Ce n'est pas une communaut\u00e9. Conclusion # Au final, c'est beaucoup de talent qui se perd, beaucoup d'\u00e9nergie, tout cela parce que, du temps de L\u00e9gendes , comme de Blood Lust , comme maintenant des jeux r\u00e9cents, nous les fran\u00e7ais sommes toujours dans le m\u00eame paradigme qui nous fait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer nos petites cr\u00e9ations persos, souvent peu innovantes au niveau des m\u00e9caniques de jeu, au d\u00e9triment de nos univers de jeux qui, eux, sont riches mais restent dans leur ghetto. Parce qu'on ne veut pas jouer le jeu des m\u00e9chants am\u00e9ricains ? Deux solutions donc \u00e0 mon avis : Faites des suppl\u00e9ments pour les moteurs de jeux connus et publiez sur les canaux US (drivethru, itch, Amazon) ; Travaillez \u00e0 un moteur de jeu fran\u00e7ais type Simulacres que chacun customisera dans son coin (je n'y crois pas trop). Le comble de cette situation est qu'il faut qu'on m'offre un magazine lors d'une commande pour que j'apprenne l'existence de plein de jeux fran\u00e7ais... Pauvre de nous. 14 mai 2023 Une belle fin d'ann\u00e9e et un beau d\u00e9but d'ann\u00e9e # Ces derniers mois, j'ai d\u00e9couvert pas mal de choses... Ep\u00e9es & Sorcellerie # Ep\u00e9es et Sorcellerie, premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition anglaise J'avais achet\u00e9, voil\u00e0 quelques temps, Ep\u00e9es et Sorcellerie, dans sa premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition anglaise. Malheureusement, on ne trouve pas la m\u00eame \u00e9dition en fran\u00e7ais (peut-\u00eatre l\u00e0 , le E&S_Beta.pdf ). Nicolas Desseaux a cr\u00e9\u00e9 ce jeu en fonction de son interpr\u00e9tation des trois petits livres bruns (D&D 0e) et de la fa\u00e7on de jouer dans les ann\u00e9es 70 (on notera le remplacement du D20 par 2D6, ce qui change un peu les probabilit\u00e9s). J'avais trouv\u00e9 pas mal \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque ce jeu, mais je cherchais quelque chose plus proche du Moldvay de mon adolescence. Le livre \u00e9tait all\u00e9 directement sur l'\u00e9tag\u00e8re. Aventures Fantastiques # Aventures Fantastiques, de Nicolas Desseaux M\u00eame si le titre n'est pas grandiose, en d\u00e9cembre, en zonant un peu sur Internet, je tombe sur les Aventures Fantastiques de Nicolas Desseaux. J'avoue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surpris par le PDF. Le jeu est simple et complet et conforme \u00e0 ce que j'avais retenu de mon exemplaire de Moldvay quand je l'avais encore. C'est quand m\u00eame un gros boulot avec beaucoup de contenu. Chapeau M. Desseaux ! Swords & Wizardry # Swords & Wizardry, Core Rules Par rebond, peu de temps apr\u00e8s, je tombe sur les r\u00e8gles Core de Swords & Wizardry , un joli PDF que je me fais imprimer par Lulu. J'\u00e9tais content car je tenais quelque chose de tr\u00e8s proche de ma cible, m\u00eame si cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait un peu confuse. Ce jeu, cr\u00e9\u00e9 par Matt Finch est disponible en trois \u00e9ditions : une light, une Core et une compl\u00e8te. Manifestement, la source est un m\u00e9lange de B/X et de BECMI. Basic Fantasy Roleplaying Game # J'avoue avoir, ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, pas mal utilis\u00e9 BFRP en raison du mat\u00e9riel disponible en ligne, et aussi d'une traduction acceptable. J'avais, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, pas mal regard\u00e9 OSRIC, mais le volume du bouquin m'avait fait un peu peur. Petite r\u00e9flexion sur les \u00e9ditions OSR # En me baladant dans les \u00e9ditions OSR inspir\u00e9es de D&D, force est de constater que l'innovation n'est pas au rendez-vous. Certes, les vieux comme moi aiment bien retrouver leurs jeux d'ados, mais les contraintes ont chang\u00e9 : certains jouent moins souvent et veulent rigoler. Je ne dis pas de jouer des personnages trop puissants mais d\u00e9marrer avec un clerc de niveau 1 sans aucun sort et avec 3 PdV, c'est craignos quand on ne joue pas souvent. Une interrogation de fond que j'ai quand \u00e0 ces jeux OSR est pourquoi ont-ils tous gard\u00e9 la magie vancienne, qui n'est quand m\u00eame pas g\u00e9niale. J'ai droit \u00e0 un sort de niveau 1, je le pr\u00e9pare et puis une fois jet\u00e9, je l'oublie ? Et j'ai 1d4 PdV ? Ouah, \u00e7a aussi c'est bien nase. Le guerrier lui, peut taper autant de fois qu'il veut, m\u00eame \u00e0 bas niveau. Je ne dis pas qu'il faille aller dans l'autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 mais vraiment, cette magie vancienne n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 de mon go\u00fbt. Donc, pas d'innovation dans ces jeux OSR ? OK, ils respectent le ma\u00eetre Gygax (moi aussi d'ailleurs, je v\u00e9n\u00e8re la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition d'AD&D), mais ce n'est pas une raison pour limiter l'usage de la licence OGL \u00e0 une copie pure et simple du pass\u00e9. Quelle \u00e9trange manque d'ambition que cela... Quand on voit les efforts immenses d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00e9crire ces bouquins, ne serait-ce que ceux que j'ai cit\u00e9s, dont les PDF sont gratuits, c'est fou de ne pas avoir propos\u00e9 quelques petites modifications. Pour en revenir \u00e0 la magie, on dirait que c'est un tabou. Apr\u00e8s quelques recherches, j'ai trouv\u00e9 : Un vague suppl\u00e9ment de D&D ( AD&D Player's Options: Spells & Magic ) qui d\u00e9finit un syst\u00e8me de magie \u00e0 points mais tr\u00e8s proche du syst\u00e8me de base ; Le suppl\u00e9ment apparemment tr\u00e8s connu de Matt Blakeley, The Elements of Magic , qui propose une vision assez nouvelle de la magie quoique encore tr\u00e8s compatible avec D&D. Non, il semble que, dans l'OSR, pour avoir le syst\u00e8me de jeu de D&D mais une magie non vancienne, il faille joueur \u00e0 autre chose. Oui, ce sont des clones, j'ai compris. Mais quand m\u00eame... La Forge de Papier # Puis j'ai d\u00e9couvert la Forge de Papier . Alors l\u00e0, chapeau. Ce site de fans de D&D reprend des jeux et des modules du pass\u00e9 et les revoit, compl\u00e8te, traduit, corrige. C'est hallucinant. La mat\u00e9riel produit est de niveau professionnel, c'est gratuit et cela donne acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des textes depuis longtemps difficiles \u00e0 trouver et dont les traductions originales \u00e9taient souvent d\u00e9fectueuses (je ne vous dis pas les efforts qu'il m'a fallu pour comprendre mon Moldvay en fran\u00e7ais avant de jouer pour la premi\u00e8re fois !). C'est hallucinant. Bravo, bravo et mille merci ! Moi qui me plaignait de ne pas voir de nouvelles \u00e9ditions des vieux jeux de r\u00f4les fran\u00e7ais, des \u00e9quipes fran\u00e7aises d'une qualit\u00e9 exceptionnelle travaillent. Allez sur leur site, et aidez-lez si vous le pouvez. Pour ma part, je pr\u00e9vois de me faire imprimer B/X en fran\u00e7ais dans les versions \"Forge\" par Lulu bient\u00f4t (h\u00e9h\u00e9h\u00e9, rire sardonique). Le Donjon du Dragon # Je me suis aussi inscrit sur le site Donjon Du Dragon o\u00f9 un grand nombre de fans de D&D se sont retrouv\u00e9s pour travailler sur des projets de traduction et de r\u00e9\u00e9dition de suppl\u00e9ments pass\u00e9s. Je n'ai pas eu le temp de bien d\u00e9couvrir le site mais j'ai lu quelques num\u00e9ros de r\u00e9tro-donj et j'ai appris plein de choses. La cerise sur le g\u00e2teau : DCC # Oui, alors apr\u00e8s la jouissance, la double jouissance ! Je venais juste de finir la version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e par la Forge de Moldvay, que je tombe sur une version de DCC en anglais. Je suis rest\u00e9 sur le derche ! Tout ce dont j'avais r\u00eav\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u00e0 : Une grande compatibilit\u00e9 avec D&D (et donc une facilit\u00e9 d'adaptation de n'importe quel sc\u00e9nario D&D), Un esprit tr\u00e8s D&D (avec les races comme classes), Un syst\u00e8me de jeu revu avec des d\u00e9s bizarres, Des innovations partout permettant de prendre en compte les contraintes des joueurs actuels (tout le monde ne peut pas jouer en campagnes), Un syst\u00e8me de magie revu avec des effets amusants (et meurtriers), Etc. Sur l'esprit, je dois dire que je tire mon chapeau \u00e0 Joseph Goodman son cr\u00e9ateur et que j'adh\u00e8re \u00e0 100% avec sa d\u00e9marche. On pourrait la r\u00e9sumer aux points suivants : Goodman recherche l'esprit du D&D des origines non seulement au travers des r\u00e8gles, mais au travers des sources du jeu, souvent assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appendice N de AD&D 1e, appendice dont le contenu \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sorti dans le num\u00e9ro 4 du Dragon trois ann\u00e9es auparavant. Les lectures recommand\u00e9es par GG dans The Dragon num\u00e9ro 4 en 1976 L'appendice N de GG dans le Dungeon Master's Guide en 1979 Goodman cherche a retraduire cet esprit dans les r\u00e8gles, notamment de la magie. En cela, il garde pas mal de m\u00e9caniques de base type D20 mais en les tordant pour qu'elles s'adaptent plus \u00e0 cet univers o\u00f9 la magie est dangereuse. Ce faisant, il propose des \"corrections\" au syst\u00e8me de jeu et force est de constater que ces corrections sont bienvenues. Le livre est gouvern\u00e9 par un vrai souci d'efficacit\u00e9 et de logique et de caract\u00e9risation tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise des sorts et de leurs effets. Goodman vante l'innovation et incite les gens qui aiment la fantasy \u00e0 utiliser les licences OGL pour innover et non pas pour refaire du D&D ou du AD&D exactement comme autrefois. Esp\u00e9rons qu'il ouvre la voie \u00e0 du nouveau, dans un monde o\u00f9 le conformisme est quand m\u00eame important. Si c'est pour jouer \u00e0 D&D, pourquoi jouer \u00e0 un retro-clone et pas \u00e0 D&D (d'o\u00f9 l'importance des travaux de la Forge) ? Mr Goodman, belle le\u00e7on ! Apr\u00e8s avoir lu pr\u00e8s de 100 pages en anglais, je me suis aper\u00e7u qu'il existait une version fran\u00e7aise et que pas mal de gens sur le net disaient du bien de la traduction. Je l'ai command\u00e9e dare-dare sur le site de l'\u00e9diteur Akileos et j'ai re\u00e7u le PDF et le bouquin en parfait \u00e9tat dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable. Le bouquin est hallucinant : un gros pav\u00e9 de presque 500 pages avec une couverture cartonn\u00e9e, proposant un grand nombre d'illustrations de grande qualit\u00e9 (tr\u00e8s retro- donj).

Pour un MJ, cela veut dire improvisation (et tables al\u00e9atoires), ouverture d'esprit, surfer sur les id\u00e9es des joueurs, sur leurs d\u00e9fauts aussi, c'est se laisser baratiner (sans jet de d\u00e9s), arbitrer dans le sens \"on va voir si le truc loufoque que vous tentez marche\", c'est conna\u00eetre les r\u00e8gles tellement par c\u0153ur que jamais on ne regarde le manuel, c'est jouer des PNJ qui peuvent trouver trouver un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 une situation, ou sont joueurs avec les joueurs, ou sont mauvais et fomentent, ou ont un c\u00f4t\u00e9 singulier que les joueurs n'oublieront pas.

On pourrait croire au premier abord que toutes ces listes de choses sont un r\u00e9pertoire plus ou moins h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8ne mais, la plupart du temps, ces listes mod\u00e9lisent diff\u00e9rents \u00e9l\u00e9ments de diff\u00e9rents mondes de fantaisie que l'on trouve dans les livres de fantasy de diff\u00e9rents auteurs (voir les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de GaryGygax ici ). De plus, les diverses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de mod\u00e9lisation de ces mondes renvoient les uns aux autres : les sorts renvoient aux monstres qui renvoient aux objets magiques.

Et comme OD&D ne propose pas vraiment de monde ( Greyhawk est embryonnaire et Blackmoor est quand m\u00eame un tout petit endroit), les r\u00e8gles compl\u00e8tes donnent la possibilit\u00e9 de mod\u00e9liser les diff\u00e9rents univers de fantasy et d'ouvrir le jeu \u00e0 d'autres perspectives. Cet amour des r\u00e8gles, ces derni\u00e8res ayant toujours des objectifs de simulation, est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, car le syst\u00e8me n'appara\u00eet jamais comme \u00e9tant rigide. Le coup du nombre de niveaux de monstres, par exemple, est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, le groupe d'opposants \u00e9tant vus comme une entit\u00e9 globale au travers du nombre de d\u00e9s de dommages que le groupe peut encaisser. Chaque sort, chaque pouvoir psionique peut devenir un mini-syst\u00e8me dans lequel le niveau de ma\u00eetrise (encore un concept int\u00e9ressant) intervient. Dans une mise en page hyper-compacte, l'inventivit\u00e9 est remarquable et il faut se pencher profond\u00e9ment dans les r\u00e8gles pour comprendre toutes les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences que ces derni\u00e8res font entre elles. Evidemment, il est fort possible que toutes ces r\u00e8gles n'aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \"play-test\u00e9es\" pendant des mois, mais soient le fruit d'une logique de semi-improvisation en mode \"homebrew\" (faites \u00e0 la maison).

Je l'ai crois\u00e9 lors d'une semaine de jeux \u00e0 Morestel en 1987 ou 1988 sans doute, un truc organis\u00e9 par le Dragon Radieux , Paul et Pascaline Chion. Je me souviens d'un Blood Bowl grandeur nature... Tout \u00e7a ne nous rajeunit pas. A l'\u00e9poque, nous avions jou\u00e9 \u00e0 L\u00e9gendes , \u00e0 Empires & Dynasties , avec Patrick Durand-Peyrolles himself, et \u00e0 R\u00eave de Dragon avec Denis Gerfaud himself.

En une apr\u00e8s-midi, nous avons fait quelques m\u00e8tres en dehors du village celte pour se faire attaquer et... c'est tout ! C'est affligeant et pas ma fa\u00e7on de faire du JDR (voir mes autres articles sur le sujet).

Je comprends cela. Il faut que la partie m\u00e9canique aille vite. Si les joueurs prennent de temps \u00e0 discuter pendant les phases d'enqu\u00eates, c'est normal, mais la partie combat doit d\u00e9poter. Il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la dualit\u00e9 de la sc\u00e8ne ind\u00e9pendante internationale et fran\u00e7aise du JDR avec, \u00e0 la fois, des m\u00e9caniques de jeu tr\u00e8s innovantes et des univers pas tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9atifs. J'avoue que je suis d'accord avec cette analyse, moi qui revient dans ce monde de nombreuses ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l'avoir quitt\u00e9.

J'ai une petite exp\u00e9rience des jeux \u00e9crits par Croc, jeux, qui g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, ne m'ont pas compl\u00e8tement enthousiasm\u00e9 : J'ai fait jouer Bitume , mais je ne suis pas fan ; J'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Magnas Veritas , mais je n'ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 emball\u00e9 ; J'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Bloodlust et j'ai bien aim\u00e9 le coup des armes poss\u00e9d\u00e9es ; \u00e7a fait un peu Stormbringer g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 dans le monde de Warhammer ; mais je pense que c'est un peu trop dark pour moi.

C'est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant. La feuille de route de Bill Slavicsek de mai 2005 donne le ton avec des buts de conception du jeu (je traduis ses 8 demandes au groupe de designers). 1. Le jeu doit \u00eatre un jeu de r\u00f4les m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique Cela reste DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, et nous devons rester fid\u00e8les \u00e0 nos racines. 2. Le Dungeon Master comme Storyteller Nous avons discut\u00e9 de l'impasse du DM comme opposant aux joueurs, et donc nous croyons que le DM comme Storyteller est un concept plus fort et mieux adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 notre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle. 3. Une exp\u00e9rience de jeu coop\u00e9ratif De m\u00eame, nous voulons maintenir l'aspect coop\u00e9ratif et \u00e9quipe des groupes d'aventuriers. 4. M\u00e9caniques de base Il faut garder le d20, les jets \u00e9lev\u00e9s indiquant un bon r\u00e9sultat, les classes, les niveaux, et les races fantastiques. Il faut que le jeu reste unifi\u00e9 et solide dans ses m\u00e9caniques, et il faut suivre cette voie dans tous ses aspects. 5. Des tactiques tridimensionnelles Nous voulons continuer d'utiliser des figurines localis\u00e9es dans des carr\u00e9s de 1.5 m\u00e8tre (\"5-foot squares\"). Nous voulons concevoir des mini-jeux (escarmouche) pour fonctionner avec le JDR. Nous en reparlerons prochainement. 6. Des options et non pas des restrictions Nous voulons maintenir cette philosophie dans la nouvelle \u00e9dition, m\u00eame si nous entrevoyons des endroits dans le jeu o\u00f9 nous voudrions mettre en place quelques restrictions pour l'\u00e9quilibre du jeu. 7. Am\u00e9liorer le jeu Pour bien pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle \u00e9dition au public, nous devons cr\u00e9er un meilleur jeu, plus rapide et plus robuste. Les am\u00e9liorations devraient inclure quelque chose de cool \u00e0 chaque niveau, plus de place \u00e0 la conception pour les options des personnages (mais attention \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9), un meilleur m\u00e9lange de m\u00e9caniques (\"crunch\") et d'histoire ou d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de roleplay (\"fluff\"). Supprimer les r\u00e8gles, les sorts et les sous-syst\u00e8mes probl\u00e9matiques. 8. Faire un jeu facile \u00e0 concevoir, \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper, \u00e0 \u00e9diter D&D 3.0/3.5 est un monstre dans lequel il est tr\u00e8s difficile de construire, depuis les blocs de statistiques jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9quilibre des rencontres. Corrigeons ce probl\u00e8me une fois pour toutes et rendons facile la cr\u00e9ation de produits dans le futur. Si nous pouvions passer moins de temps sur les d\u00e9tails et plus sur le facteur facilit\u00e9 pour les conceptions futures, nous serions tous gagnants.","title":"La gen\u00e8se de D&amp;D 4e"},{"location":"blog/2023/#quest-ce-quun-jeu-extensible","text":"Donc, force est de constater que l'\u00e9quipe de conception du jeu a suivi les recommandations, notamment la derni\u00e8re qui est fondamentale : pour qu'un jeu soit extensible, il faut qu'il propose une certaine \"horizontalit\u00e9\", soit des principes fondateurs sur lesquels il est possible de b\u00e2tir facilement aujourd'hui comme demain. Les jeux qui complexifient le syst\u00e8me et le verrouillent rendent complexes toutes les \u00e9volutions. \u00c9videmment, les am\u00e9ricains y voient un probl\u00e8me financier, mais le probl\u00e8me est, comme le dit Slavicsek, avant tout un probl\u00e8me de conception. Si je voulais \u00eatre ironique, je dirais que le point 8 pourrait se r\u00e9sumer \u00e0 : comment D&D 4 devient aussi souple que GURPS Core System ? Une des premi\u00e8res choses que l'on apprend dans le Races & Classes , c'est que le d\u00e9fi est relev\u00e9 au travers des sources de pouvoirs (\"power sources\"). Dans la mesure o\u00f9 chaque classe peut tirer de sa propre source de pouvoir ses pouvoirs, le syst\u00e8me remplit sa promesse de pouvoir \u00eatre extensible \u00e0 l'infini : les sources de pouvoirs \"g\u00e9n\u00e8rent\" des diff\u00e9rentes classes (et il sera donc possible d'en cr\u00e9er de nouvelles dans le futur). Il reste toujours possible de sp\u00e9cialiser \"en profondeur\" les classes, mais \"verticalement, sans impacter les autres classes, car n'ayant pas la m\u00eame source de pouvoirs, elles ne sont pas \"en collision\" ou en risque d'incoh\u00e9rence. Bien s\u00fbr, cela implique que le guerrier a une structure de pouvoirs qui est la m\u00eame que celle des magiciens et aux clercs , m\u00eame si son pouvoir est \"martial\", alors que les autres sont respectivement \"arcanes\" ou \"divins\". Ainsi, une source de pouvoirs \"psionic\" est envisageable \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des autres (cf. Player's Guide volume 2 ). A chacun sa source de pouvoirs ! Ce choix de conception a de multiples avantages : Chaque niveau de personnage peut \u00eatre \"tun\u00e9\" aux petits oignons, et donc \u00eatre \"cool \u00e0 passer (besoin num\u00e9ro 7 de Slavicsek). Comme l'\u00e9chelle de tous les pouvoirs est absolue (en gros chaque pouvoir est d\u00e9crit de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on sur une \u00e9chelle universelle), les diff\u00e9rentes classes de personnages sont comparables en puissance ! D'o\u00f9 il s'en suit que le jeu peut \u00eatre \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 parce qu'au final, tout en \u00e9tant dans des \"espaces de pouvoirs\" diff\u00e9rents, les diff\u00e9rentes classes peuvent se comparer les unes aux autres et peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es les unes sur les autres. Je voudrais r\u00e9sumer ces choix de conception par le diagramme suivant : Le mod\u00e8le est bi-dimensionnel : Chaque source de pouvoir (par exemple A) peut abriter plusieurs classes qui ne sont pas toutes d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es (par exemple A2) ; Il est possible d'ajouter des sources de pouvoirs pour cr\u00e9er de nouvelles classes ; Dans le futur, il ne sera pas plus difficile qu'aujourd'hui de cr\u00e9er de nouvelles classes au travers de nouvelles sources de pouvoirs (par exemple D). On peut dire que la conception du mod\u00e8le est plut\u00f4t bien faite, surtout si l'on envisage un monde avec diff\u00e9rents formes de magie. D'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, le syst\u00e8me de classes et de niveaux est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9, et de l'autre, il est extensible \"horizontalement\" (on dirait vraiment qu'on parle de software parfois).","title":"Qu'est-ce qu'un jeu extensible ?"},{"location":"blog/2023/#dd-4e-copie-sur-les-jeux-videos","text":"Il est possible que le syst\u00e8me soit copi\u00e9 sur les jeux massivement multijoueurs mais ce n'est pas \u00e9vident au premier abord.

En tous cas, j'avoue que cette lecture est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante et que je suis tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9ablement surpris par ce syst\u00e8me de jeu. On a souvent dit que le jeu serait sorti sous n'importe quel autre nom, il aurait fait un buzz du tonnerre et c'est sans doute vrai.

Le syst\u00e8me d20 appliqu\u00e9 aux univers modernes, \u00e7a faisait tripper pas grand monde dans les ann\u00e9es 2000, parce que cela semblait un choix par d\u00e9faut depuis la faillite de West End Games et donc la disparition du support de Star Wars d6. Mais quand D&D 4e est sorti, le monde de l'OGL, des copies de OD&D/D&D/AD&D/AD&D 2e/D&D 3.0/3.5, s'est pris une grosse baffe dans la t\u00eate ! Car si le jeu a \"d\u00e9plu\" (enfin commercialement je crois que c'est un vrai succ\u00e8s par rapport \u00e0 l'\u00e9dition 3.0/3.5), il a compl\u00e8tement refondu la base de D&D en brisant la plupart des totems ! Je pense que Joseph Goodman, qui faisait alors des sc\u00e9narios pour D&D 3.0/3.5 s'est fait \u00e9lectrocuter (il faut que je recherche des interviews de lui \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque) ! Alors que des milliers de joueurs (et Paizo avec Pathfinder ) restaient coinc\u00e9s dans la nostalgie d'une copie litt\u00e9rale d'une des versions du pass\u00e9, Wizzards sortait un jeu qui cassait la baraque, un vrai D&D mais compl\u00e8tement refondu avec un c\u00f4t\u00e9 jeu de plateau tactique super amusant ! Incroyable ! Tout le monde n'a pas compris d'ailleurs, \u00e0 commencer par Paizo, tellement la refonte et la pulv\u00e9risation des tabous Gygaxiens a \u00e9t\u00e9 forte ! Un D&D coh\u00e9rent, amusant, \u00e0 la m\u00e9canique bien huil\u00e9e, r\u00e9inventant tous les univers du ma\u00eetre Gygax mais en voulant \u00eatre jouable : Forgotten Realms : mouais pas le plus r\u00e9ussi ; Dark Sun : on dirait que D&D 4e a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour Dark Sun, Les manuels sur les plans sont totalement refondus pour devenir jouables, Les autres, je connais trop peu. Pour moi, Goodman s'est dit : \" D&D 4e a bris\u00e9 tous les tabous. Qu'est-ce que je voudrais mettre dans mon OGL ? Un peu de Cthulhu, un peu de Stormbringer avec les effets retour de la magie quand elle rate, un peu de OD&D, un peu de fantasy genre l' appendix N de AD&D . H\u00e9 voil\u00e0 ! Je peux faire de l'OGL perso, sans me prendre les foudres de tous les extr\u00e9mistes : ils s'acharnent sur D&D 4e ! Quelle bonne aubaine !\" C'est devenu DCC .

BRP : avec la nouvelle licence ORC , le syst\u00e8me de jeu va devenir plus facile encore \u00e0 utiliser. GURPS : quand on a lu quelques extensions, on voit comment avoir des mondes avec leurs r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9cifiques dans un univers de jeu connu par les joueurs et les MJs.

Donc, l\u00e0 Posidonia sort deux super produits avec deux bonnes accroches. Mais comme je n'ai pas beaucoup de temps, ni \u00e0 la table de jeu, ni en mode prep, il me faut quelque chose qui se d\u00e9cline vite sur un syst\u00e8me que je connaisse.

Supposons que Emysfer soit un monde pour D&D 5e : Je peux jouer en France dans ce monde ; Je peux favoriser que des aventures soient faites par d'autres et donc ouvrir une communaut\u00e9 de joueurs ; Je peux le traduire ; Je peux le vendre sur Dungeon Masters Guild ; Dans 3 ans, je peux en faire une seconde \u00e9dition pour D&D 6e. Attention, je ne suis pas un agent de Wizards ! Mais l\u00e0, on tient quelque chose. L'aspect game design reviendrait, dans ce cas, \u00e0 adapter \u00e0 D&D 5e les concepts tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifiques aux monde de Emysfer (la m\u00e9moire surtout). Pareil pour les Terres de Matnak , sachant que le monde pourrait \u00eatre facilement adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 Warhammer. Il faut voir aussi ce qui existe : il serait \u00e9tonnant que AD&D 1e ou Warhammer n'aient pas \u00e9voqu\u00e9 les transformations bestiales des humains. Avec une approche d'extension, id\u00e9alement multi-syst\u00e8me de jeux, le monde peut perdurer. Alors que des gens comme moi n'ont plus envie de lire des bouquins de r\u00e8gles avec plein de trucs bizarres. Par contre, nous sommes consommateurs de mondes (ou de morceaux de mondes) et de sc\u00e9narios \u00e9piques. Ce n'est pas de ma faute si la plupart des moteurs de jeux puissants viennent des US : ils sont six fois plus nombreux que nous, donc tout est plus play-test\u00e9, industrialis\u00e9, peaufin\u00e9, \u00e9dition apr\u00e8s \u00e9dition. Nous, on gal\u00e8re, parce qu'il est tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9 de monter des communaut\u00e9s de JDR chez nous : elles sont hyper fractionn\u00e9es.

Je suis d'accord avec lui, mais ce n'est pas en publiant des micro-JDR sans communaut\u00e9 que l'on pourra redresser la barre. Casus Belli avait, dans le temps, tent\u00e9 de surmonter ce probl\u00e8me, d'abord en s'accrochant \u00e0 BRP , puis \u00e0 Simulacres qui est un jeu ultra-merdique. L'id\u00e9e \u00e9tait que chaque sc\u00e9nario pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9clin\u00e9 dans le moteur de jeux g\u00e9n\u00e9rique \"fran\u00e7ais\", bonne id\u00e9e en soi, sauf que je n'ai jamais r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 dig\u00e9rer les \"concepts\" de Simulacres . Il en r\u00e9sulte un probl\u00e8me de fond : nous sommes pilot\u00e9s par les jeux US (oui) et la multitude de jeux fran\u00e7ais atomise le march\u00e9 (oui) avec des prix horribles (oui) et des toutes petites s\u00e9ries (oui).

En comparaison : Laelith la cit\u00e9 : 70\u20ac ; R\u00eave de Dragon + Invitation au Voyage 55\u20ac+55\u20ac ; M\u00e9ga 5 , en rupture de stock aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s sa sortie, aucun suivi commercial ; Mal\u00e9fices , rupture de stock ; etc. Alors, oui, ce sont des \u0153uvres d'art, mais on peut jouer avec ? Et quel suivi ? J'ai achet\u00e9 Empires et Dynasties par nostalgie et parce que j'avais perdu mon exemplaire. Philippe Jaillet en avait un neuf (miracle ?). Ce jeu propose un effort \u00e9norme de description du monde de R\u00e9ah mais, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un succ\u00e8s, parce qu'il cumule deux d\u00e9savantages : un monde complexe et inconnu, compl\u00e8tement li\u00e9 \u00e0 son auteur, et un syst\u00e8me de jeu sp\u00e9cifique (voir mon sujet sur l'accessibilit\u00e9 des JDR ).

Certes, les vieux comme moi aiment bien retrouver leurs jeux d'ados, mais les contraintes ont chang\u00e9 : certains jouent moins souvent et veulent rigoler. Je ne dis pas de jouer des personnages trop puissants mais d\u00e9marrer avec un clerc de niveau 1 sans aucun sort et avec 3 PdV, c'est craignos quand on ne joue pas souvent. Une interrogation de fond que j'ai quand \u00e0 ces jeux OSR est pourquoi ont-ils tous gard\u00e9 la magie vancienne, qui n'est quand m\u00eame pas g\u00e9niale. J'ai droit \u00e0 un sort de niveau 1, je le pr\u00e9pare et puis une fois jet\u00e9, je l'oublie ? Et j'ai 1d4 PdV ? Ouah, \u00e7a aussi c'est bien nase.

OK, ils respectent le ma\u00eetre Gygax (moi aussi d'ailleurs, je v\u00e9n\u00e8re la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition d'AD&D), mais ce n'est pas une raison pour limiter l'usage de la licence OGL \u00e0 une copie pure et simple du pass\u00e9.

Non, il semble que, dans l'OSR, pour avoir le syst\u00e8me de jeu de D&D mais une magie non vancienne, il faille joueur \u00e0 autre chose. Oui, ce sont des clones, j'ai compris.

Tout ce dont j'avais r\u00eav\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u00e0 : Une grande compatibilit\u00e9 avec D&D (et donc une facilit\u00e9 d'adaptation de n'importe quel sc\u00e9nario D&D), Un esprit tr\u00e8s D&D (avec les races comme classes), Un syst\u00e8me de jeu revu avec des d\u00e9s bizarres, Des innovations partout permettant de prendre en compte les contraintes des joueurs actuels (tout le monde ne peut pas jouer en campagnes), Un syst\u00e8me de magie revu avec des effets amusants (et meurtriers), Etc. Sur l'esprit, je dois dire que je tire mon chapeau \u00e0 Joseph Goodman son cr\u00e9ateur et que j'adh\u00e8re \u00e0 100% avec sa d\u00e9marche. On pourrait la r\u00e9sumer aux points suivants : Goodman recherche l'esprit du D&D des origines non seulement au travers des r\u00e8gles, mais au travers des sources du jeu, souvent assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appendice N de AD&D 1e, appendice dont le contenu \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sorti dans le num\u00e9ro 4 du Dragon trois ann\u00e9es auparavant. Les lectures recommand\u00e9es par GG dans The Dragon num\u00e9ro 4 en 1976 L'appendice N de GG dans le Dungeon Master's Guide en 1979 Goodman cherche a retraduire cet esprit dans les r\u00e8gles, notamment de la magie. En cela, il garde pas mal de m\u00e9caniques de base type D20 mais en les tordant pour qu'elles s'adaptent plus \u00e0 cet univers o\u00f9 la magie est dangereuse. Ce faisant, il propose des \"corrections\" au syst\u00e8me de jeu et force est de constater que ces corrections sont bienvenues. Le livre est gouvern\u00e9 par un vrai souci d'efficacit\u00e9 et de logique et de caract\u00e9risation tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise des sorts et de leurs effets. Goodman vante l'innovation et incite les gens qui aiment la fantasy \u00e0 utiliser les licences OGL pour innover et non pas pour refaire du D&D ou du AD&D exactement comme autrefois. Esp\u00e9rons qu'il ouvre la voie \u00e0 du nouveau, dans un monde o\u00f9 le conformisme est quand m\u00eame important. Si c'est pour jouer \u00e0 D&D, pourquoi jouer \u00e0 un retro-clone et pas \u00e0 D&D (d'o\u00f9 l'importance des travaux de la Forge) ? Mr Goodman, belle le\u00e7on !

S'il est bon en cr\u00e9ation d'univers et d'aventures, Monte Cook ne semble pas bon en game design . C'est dommage mais cela semble un fait incontestable. Si la m\u00e9canique de base ressemble \u00e0 D&D (1d20 + modificateurs contre une difficult\u00e9), tout est plus compliqu\u00e9 et confus. Une cr\u00e9ation des PJ confuse # La cr\u00e9ation des persos tout d'abord. Cela part d'un postulat un peu simpliste : \"I am an adjective noun that verbs \", avec : Le nom repr\u00e9sentant la classe/le type de PJ (tous univers), L'adjectif qui est le \"descriptor\" du PJ (tous univers), Le verbe qui est un peu son point fort (sp\u00e9cifique au genre), le \"focus\". J'avoue que repr\u00e9senter tous les types de personnages dans tous les univers par quatre pauvres classes/types de personnages est r\u00e9ellement \u00e9touffant, surtout si l'on consid\u00e8re que le Warrior et l'Explorer ont quand m\u00eame beaucoup en commun (1 seul point de diff\u00e9rence sur les scores par d\u00e9faut !). J'ai fait une petite table dans cet article . Stat /character Type Warrior (Might) Warrior (Speed) Adept Explorer Speaker Might 10 10 7 10 8 Speed 10 10 9 9 9 Intellect 8 8 12 9 11 Points to assign +6 +6 +6 +6 +6 Effort Tier 1 1 1 1 1 1 Edge Tier 1 Might 1 Speed 1 Intellect 1 Might 1 Intellect 1 Si l'on regarde d'autres syst\u00e8mes g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, que ce soit GURPS ou Basic Roleplaying , on ne sent pas cet espace aussi restreint. M\u00eame dans le SRD de D&D 5e, nous avons 12 classes de personnages, juste pour faire du D&D ! L\u00e0, quatre classes de personnages dont deux sont presqu'identiques. Ensuite, le fait que les PJs n'aient que 3 caract\u00e9ristiques (Might, Speed, Intellect) renforce ce sentiment de ne pas avoir beaucoup de choix. Dans les JDR g\u00e9n\u00e9riques disponibles, les caract\u00e9ristiques sont plus \u00e9tendes, notamment D&D (6) et Basic Roleplaying (7 voire 8 avec avec la SAN). M\u00eame GURPS en a 4 de base et quelques unes d\u00e9riv\u00e9es. En plus, tout est tr\u00e8s rigide. Les types de personnages n'offrent pas beaucoup de choix dans leur d\u00e9veloppement qui est souvent tr\u00e8s tactique, beaucoup plus que les avantages des classes de D&D . La partie Descriptor me met particuli\u00e8rement en col\u00e8re. Quand on vit dans le monde des JDR, on ne peut pas ne pas conna\u00eetre Risus (1993), Fudge (1995) ou m\u00eame FU (2010). Dans ces trois exemples de jeux, les descriptors sont plus ou moins libres et donnent l'occasion d'une discussion avec le MJ pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des bonus dus au descriptors. Mais dans Cypher, les descriptors sont impos\u00e9s, et ils apportent leur lot d'Abilities (des Skills, des Avantages, des augmentations de pools, des Pouvoirs, etc.) alors m\u00eame que le joueur a fait des choix structurants dans la partie Type de personnage. Difficile donc d'\u00eatre coh\u00e9rent. Il faut revenir en arri\u00e8re aux abilities li\u00e9es au type de PJ. Ne vous inqui\u00e9tez pas, Monte nous refait le coup une seconde fois ! H\u00e9 oui, car il faut maintenant choisir le Focus qui lui aussi apporte son lot d'Abilities. Et donc tout est \u00e0 recommencer. Et je n'aime pas les descriptors impos\u00e9s. Soit, les descriptors sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 du roleplay, souvent pour gagner un avantage quand ces derniers sont applicables, soit il faut utiliser des quantifications. Oui alors, OK, Monte ne voulait pas faire comme les autres, et notamment il ne voulait pas que la cr\u00e9ation de personnage soit \"habituelle\" : caract\u00e9ristiques, puis comp\u00e9tences, puis talents, puis sorts ou psioniques. Il n'emp\u00eache que la promesse initiale d'avoir une cr\u00e9ation de PJ facile est, op\u00e9rationnellement, rat\u00e9e. Des r\u00e8gles \u00e9trangement compliqu\u00e9es # Il faut aussi comprendre les pools et le r\u00f4le de l'Effort qui est en fait un bonus cach\u00e9 : l'Effort diminue la difficult\u00e9 de 1 et donc octroie un genre de bonus de +3 au d20. Comme le PJ doit diminuer la difficult\u00e9 (je reviendrai sur ce point) plut\u00f4t qu'augmenter ses modificateurs, la m\u00e9canique est invers\u00e9e. En plus, elle introduit une notion de gestion des \"ressources\" car les pools ont aussi un genre de r\u00f4le de points de vie m\u00e9lang\u00e9s avec des points de magie, sachant qu'on a quand m\u00eame une jauge de blessures... Ouah, pas facile \u00e0 capter tout \u00e7a. On notera que les pools ne sont pas des pools de d\u00e9s, mais des pools de points qui sont consomm\u00e9s lors de l'utilisation de certains avantages (abilities)... Bof. Diminuer la difficult\u00e9 # Alors que nous sommes dans un syst\u00e8me de type d20 + modificateurs contre une difficult\u00e9, toute une partie des r\u00e8gles vise \u00e0 diminuer la difficult\u00e9 . Ce n'est pas facilement jouable, car la difficult\u00e9 est donn\u00e9e par le MJ et doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e par les joueurs... C'est tr\u00e8s contre-intuitif car, sans \u00eatre un fan absolu de D&D , dans 5e, les joueurs empilent les bonus mais la difficult\u00e9 de l'action est absolue , elle n'est pas relative aux joueurs. En plus, les difficult\u00e9s vont par palier de 3, ce qui ne facilite pas les choses (alors que les bonus de D&D sont souvent sur des paliers de 2, ce qui est plus facile \u00e0 compter). Plus d'informations sur github.com/orey/ttrpg/Cypher . L'intrusion du MJ # Alors l\u00e0, je dois \u00eatre stupide mais je n'ai pas compris : le MJ est toujours \"intrusif\" dans la mesure o\u00f9 il g\u00e8re l'univers et le comportement des PNJ. La premi\u00e8re excuse pour cette m\u00e9canique est que les joueurs font tous les jets. En fait, ce n'est pas vrai. De ce que j'ai compris les joueurs font tous les jets durant le combat mais ils n'ont pas \u00e0 faire tous les jets relatifs aux comportements des PNJ, c'est absurde. Les PNJ vont donc se comporter comme le veut le MJ. L'intervention est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme apportant une complication, complication qui doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par un point d'exp\u00e9rience du MJ envers le joueur. On continue dans la confusion totale : quelle exp\u00e9rience a \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9e par le joueur ? Aucune. Est-ce que ce dernier a fait une action h\u00e9ro\u00efque de sorte qu'on le gratifie d'un point de chance/de h\u00e9ros/ de destin/ de force ? Non. This means that the GM uses experience points as a narrative tool. Whenever it seems appropriate, he can introduce complications into the game that affect a specific player, but when he does so, he gives that player 1 XP. C'est grotesque. Et d'abord, comment le MJ sait qu'il est intrusif et non qu'il joue le sc\u00e9nario pr\u00e9vu ? Il se peut qu'une complication soit pr\u00e9vue dans la sc\u00e8ne, c'est m\u00eame g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le cas. Alors les joueurs vont pleurer pour avoir des points d'exp\u00e9rience parce que le MJ apporte des complications ? C'est d\u00e9bile. Cerise sur le g\u00e2teau, le joueur peut refuser l'intrusion en perdant un point d'exp\u00e9rience. Monte indique que c'est peu probable parce que les joueurs ne veulentAn example frequently used in the Numenera rulebook is the appearance of unexpected reinforcements: The GM uses an intrusion and two more chirogs drop out of the leafy canopy above you! Let\u2019s break down the options here: The GM could decide NOT to have any reinforcements up. The GM could decide that the two chirogs are DEFINITELY there and the players have no say about it. The GM could decide that the two chirogs MIGHT be there and use a GM intrusion to negotiate their arrival with the players. A purely traditional RPG only offers the first two options (and those options still exist in Numenera); but the intrusion mechanic offers the third. sans doute pas perdre leurs points. Et donc quoi ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ? Parce que si le jeu \u00e9tait narrativiste, ce serait le joueur qui raconterait comment se d\u00e9roulent les \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Mais l\u00e0, non, il ne fait que choisir, en mode meta-gaming, une option ou une autre. M\u00eame les exemples de Monte sont foireux : GM intrusion is a way to facilitate what goes on in the world outside the characters. Can the minotaur track the PCs\u2019 movements through the maze? Will the fraying rope hold? Pour moi, nous sommes dans du GMing de base. Say the PCs find a hidden console with some buttons. They learn the right order in which to press the buttons, and a section of the floor disappears. As the GM, you don\u2019t ask the players specifically where their characters are standing. Instead, you give a player 1 XP and say, \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re standing directly over this new hole in the floor.\u201d If he wanted, the player could refuse the XP, spend one of his own, and say, \u201cI leap aside to safety.\u201d Most likely, though, he\u2019ll make the defense roll that you call for and let it play out. Donc quoi, pour chaque sc\u00e8ne o\u00f9 il y des complications, pour que les joueurs daignent les accepter, on leur donne des cookies ? There are two ways for the GM to handle this kind of intrusion. You could say, \u201cYou\u2019re standing in the wrong place, so make a roll.\u201d (It\u2019s a Speed defense roll, of course.) Alternatively, you could say, \u201cYou\u2019re standing in the wrong place. The floor opens under your feet, and you fall down into the darkness.\u201d In the first example, the PC has a chance to save himself. In the second example, he doesn\u2019t. Both are viable options. The distinction is based on any number of factors, including the situation, the characters involved, and the needs of the story. This might seem arbitrary or even capricious, but you\u2019re the master of what the intrusion can and can\u2019t do. RPG mechanics need consistency so players can make intelligent decisions based on how they understand the world to work. But they\u2019ll never base their decisions on GM intrusions. They don\u2019t know when intrusions will happen or what form they will take. GM intrusions are the unpredictable and strange twists of fate that affect a person\u2019s life every day. Je ne comprends rien \u00e0 ce long blabla g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et surtout, je ne vois pas ce que \u00e7a apporte (\u00e0 part filer des r\u00e9compenses aux joueurs pour qu'ils acceptent les probl\u00e8mes). Le fait est qu'il y a d'autres moyens que le m\u00e9ta-gaming pour avoir des surprises dans l'intrigue. When player modifications (such as skill, Effort, and so on) determine that success is automatic, the GM can use GM intrusion to negate the automatic success. The player must roll for the action at its original difficulty level or target number 20, whichever is lower. Oui, mais on peut aussi le faire avec un malus circonstanciel qui justifie que l'action ne soit pas automatique. Comme c'est le MJ qui d\u00e9cide du malus, qu'est-ce que \u00e7a change ? Quelle usine \u00e0 gaz pour rien ! Sans compter que cela rajoute un aspect grippe-sous chez les joueurs qui doivent attendre avec avidit\u00e9 toutes les interventions n\u00e9gatives du MJ en disant que c'est une intrusion. J'ai lu l'article sur The Alexandrian sur les GM intrusions, mais je ne suis pas convaincu. La plupart des jeux proposent des m\u00e9caniques de complications suite \u00e0 des \u00e9checs critiques. Si vous jouez \u00e0 AD&D 1e, vous savez que Gygax avait de nombreuses tables al\u00e9atoires \u00e0 tiroirs pour apporter un peu de surprise dans les sc\u00e9narios, que ce soit aux joueurs ou au MD. Voici un exemple pris sur The Alexandrian : An example frequently used in the Numenera rulebook is the appearance of unexpected reinforcements: The GM uses an intrusion and two more chirogs drop out of the leafy canopy above you! Let\u2019s break down the options here: -The GM could decide NOT to have any reinforcements up. -The GM could decide that the two chirogs are DEFINITELY there and the players have no say about it. -The GM could decide that the two chirogs MIGHT be there and use a GM intrusion to negotiate their arrival with the players. A purely traditional RPG only offers the first two options (and those options still exist in Numenera); but the intrusion mechanic offers the third. Mais pas du tout. Dans beaucoup de sc\u00e9narios, le MJ a une table des rencontres ou il a un certain pourcentage de chances que les choses se passent. S'il juge m\u00eame \u00e0 la vol\u00e9e, en fonction de la tension autour de la table, il n'interrompt pas le jeu pour laisser voir la m\u00e9canique et casser l'ambiance. Peut-\u00eatre ai-je trop jou\u00e9 \u00e0 CoC mais je ne me vois pas du tout faire \u00e7a quand l'ambiance est install\u00e9e. De plus, je trouve cela tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9tentieux de la part du MJ, car les joueurs, normalement, dans le monde du JDR, font ce qu'ils veulent. Ils ont donc de multiples occasions de cr\u00e9er de la surprise et de solliciter la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 du MJ (sauf dans un donjon super cadr\u00e9 bien s\u00fbr). Un autre exemple pris par The Alexandrian est d'utiliser cette m\u00e9canique pour compenser les d\u00e9faillances des r\u00e8gles. L\u00e0, les bras m'en tombent. Comme si le MJ ne pouvait pas g\u00e9rer \u00e7a sans meta-gaming. Une chose est certaine : le m\u00e9ta-gaming n'est vraiment pas mon truc. Tout comme les jeux type PbtA. I'm too old for this shit . Caricature et assemblage de trucs \u00e0 la mode (de l'\u00e9poque) # On n'a pas de syst\u00e8me de magie, pas de syst\u00e8me psionique, les univers sont d\u00e9crits en 8 pages tout au plus (urg!) et le reste est finalement aride comme le syst\u00e8me lui-m\u00eame. C'est une vraie caricature de syst\u00e8me, un bric \u00e0 brac qui ne donne pas envie et ne fait pas r\u00eaver. Sans compter que le tout n'est pas simple du tout au final, car il faut prendre en compte plein de choses pour jouer. En fait, cela sent un peu l'assemblage de trucs \u00e9parses, de machins \u00e0 la mode bricol\u00e9s. Il ne manque que les pools de d\u00e9s 6 et je pense qu'on a tout. J'ai d\u00fb refaire des tables qui manquent pour jouer ou cr\u00e9er les personnages (qui se ressemblent \u00e9norm\u00e9ment), car le contenu de ces tables est d\u00e9crit dans le texte. Le jeu a beau avoir un SRD, si on regarde en arri\u00e8re, presque dix ans apr\u00e8s sa sortie, c'est un bide. Et, malheureusement, c'est m\u00e9rit\u00e9. Je cherchais un syst\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9rique et je ne choisirai pas Cypher. Autant prendre la base de D&D , de GURPS , de Basic RP ou m\u00eame de Risus et bricoler un truc. Je ne sais pas ce que vaut Numenera ou The Strange , mais pour ma part, je passe \u00e0 autre chose et oublie ce machin compl\u00e8tement nase. Note : je n'ai que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition de 2015 entre les mains et je ne sais pas si la seconde a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e ou pas, mais si j'en juge au SRD, pas tellement. 8 mai 2024 Traveller, Cepheus et tutti quanti # Traveller, l'original # Je ne suis pas un fan de Traveller , ni un connaisseur \u00e0 vrai dire. A l'\u00e9poque, nous jouions plut\u00f4t \u00e0 Space Opera ou \u00e0 M\u00e9ga 2 . Certaines de mes connaissances \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t dans Empire Galactique qui est un jeu pas mal dans sa premi\u00e8re version. Deux ou trois trucs \u00e9taient sympas dans les r\u00e8gles, de m\u00e9moire : Le syst\u00e8me de codage de personnage avec des caract\u00e9ristiques en hexad\u00e9cimal, Le syst\u00e8me d'exp\u00e9rience qui permettait de faire jouer des personnages exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du sc\u00e9nario. A l'\u00e9poque, il n'y avait pas de pouvoirs psioniques, ce qui, pour moi, \u00e9tait vraiment compliqu\u00e9, ce sujet \u00e9tant bien d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 dans Space Opera et dans M\u00e9ga . En d\u00e9cembre 2021, Games Workshop a rendu gratuit les 3 premiers livres du Classic Traveller de 1977 en mode OCR sur DriveThru. Si vous ne les avez pas, c'est un must. A cette occasion, je me suis fait un petit print Lulu, mais j'avoue ne pas avoir lu enti\u00e8rement les livres. Il y a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 amusant \u00e0 avoir une repro des JDR de l'\u00e9poque. Je sais que certains sont pass\u00e9s ma\u00eetres dans l'art de la restauration et de la reproduction. C'est mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"papier\". M\u00eame si j'ai r\u00e9cemment achet\u00e9 les PDF de la v4 de Warhammer , je suis moins \u00e0 l'aise sur les tablettes qu'avec des choses tangibles. Pour en revenir \u00e0 Games Workshop, l'\u00e9diteur de jeux gardera la licence jusqu'\u00e0 1995 environ puis cette derni\u00e8re changera de mains, en passant par GURPS, pour arriver jusqu'\u00e0 Mongoose. Le SRD de Traveller version Mongoose # En 2008, Mongoose publie sa premi\u00e8re version de Traveller, ainsi qu'un SRD dont voici les versions PDF et Word originales (on trouve le contenu sur pas mal de sites mais le PDF original n'est pas pr\u00e9sent partout). C'est une version \u00e9pur\u00e9e du jeu mais avec, \u00e0 ma grande surprise, des pouvoirs psioniques. Note : on notera l'immense stupidit\u00e9 d'avoir inclus la licence OGL V1.0a de WotC \u00e0 la fin du SRD de Traveller . Traveller n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec WotC et il n'est pas besoin de \"se couvrir\" sous la licence bidon WotC pour pouvoir reprendre les r\u00e8gles d'un jeu de 1977. C'est juste la loi am\u00e9ricaine sur le copyright (voir mon article sur le sujet des licences dans le JDR ). Parfois, l'aspect moutonnier du monde du JDR est impressionnant. Pour des gens qui passent une grosse partie de leur vie \u00e0 \u00e9crire des r\u00e8gles du jeu, ne pas avoir compris les r\u00e8gles de la loi am\u00e9ricaine sur le copyright, alors que cette connaissance est au c\u0153ur de leur business, est pour moi une \u00e9nigme. 2016 : arriv\u00e9e du Cepheus engine # Le Cepheus engine est une version \u00e9tendue du moteur de Traveller . Il est disponible en ligne gratuitement depuis pas mal de temps. Le document est aussi sur DriveThru en \"pay what you want\". Voir l' analyse de licence CSL . Traduction fran\u00e7aise # Le SRD de Cepheus a \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en fran\u00e7ais par Jack C. Munchkin, un passionn\u00e9 de Traveller , en 2022. Voici les liens : La page expliquant tout , Le PDF du SRD en fran\u00e7ais . 07 avril 2024 Des licences ouvertes dans le JDR # J'ai cr\u00e9\u00e9 une page assez d\u00e9taill\u00e9e pour discuter de ces licences : OGL, ORC, Creative Common. Vous la trouverez l\u00e0 : les licences \"ouvertes\" dans le JDR . Warhammer 4e # Voil\u00e0 quelques mois, j'\u00e9tais chez un revendeur de BDs de la r\u00e9gion et ce dernier vend quelques JdRs. J'ai achet\u00e9 la version 4 de Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP) en fran\u00e7ais. Puis je l'ai rang\u00e9 sur une \u00e9tag\u00e8re apr\u00e8s avoir lu quelques pages. Voil\u00e0 quelques jours, HumbleBundle proposait pour 25$ toute la nouvelle version de la campagne The Enemy Within . Attention, il ne reste que 7 jours ! J'ai jou\u00e9 cette campagne durant plus de deux ans avec WFRP 1e en fran\u00e7ais, avec un MJ qui, quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard, nous a quitt\u00e9. J'ai acquis les PDFs (bien que je n'aime pas \u00e7a et que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le papier) et puis j'ai commenc\u00e9 par le d\u00e9but en lisant le Starter Set . J'aime bien ce jeu pour pas mal de raisons : Il est assez facile de rentrer dans l'univers, peut-\u00eatre est-ce aussi parce que j'y ai jou\u00e9 de nombreuses sessions ; L'utilisation de la magie n'est pas compl\u00e8tement folle (elle est r\u00e9glement\u00e9e !) ; Le syst\u00e8me de jeu est top, et je le trouve encore mieux en V4 qu'en V1 ; En fait, le jeu est simple parce qu'il est coh\u00e9rent. Et puis j'aime bien ce monde assez dur, violent, et sous la menace constante du Chaos. Finalement, j'ai repris la lecture du bouquin de r\u00e8gles en PDF, en anglais cette fois, avec des petites incursions dans le bouquin papier fran\u00e7ais qui est quand m\u00eame un beau bidule bien lourd. Je ne dis pas que je ne ferai pas jouer les petits sc\u00e9narios du Starter Set . J'en ai trouv\u00e9 une version physique pas cher sur Vinted . C'est mieux pour les cartes. Il me reste \u00e0 trouver le bouquin de r\u00e8gles en anglais, parce que, j'ai de plus en plus de mal \u00e0 me faire aux traductions. Enfin, les joueurs d'aujourd'hui ne se rendent pas compte : les bouquins sont hyper-luxueux et le contenu est quand m\u00eame souvent de grande qualit\u00e9. Quand je vois les vieux jeux, les Grands Anciens comme dirait HPL, je suis impressionn\u00e9 par la qualit\u00e9 : Warhammer v4 est un tr\u00e8s bon jeu tr\u00e8s facile d'acc\u00e8s et toujours aussi exp\u00e9ditif dans les combats (notamment avec la m\u00e9canique d'avantage). D&D 5e est un tr\u00e8s bon compromis entre du vieux et du nouveau, il est moins tactique que la 4e mais reste assez proche de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition d'AD&D. Call of Cthulhu 7e, c'est toujours du CoC malgr\u00e9 le fait que les caract\u00e9ristiques soient devenues des pourcentages (mais pourquoi ?) J'ai acquis en occase Runequest 4e en anglais et l\u00e0 encore, on est dans le super classique. Quand on a v\u00e9cu les premi\u00e8res \u00e9ditions de tout cela, et les remakes plus ou moins foireux, on est content de ce qui sort aujourd'hui (m\u00eame si \u00e7a co\u00fbte toujours beaucoup de sous). A la r\u00e9flexion, c'est sans doute un truc de vieux. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait plein d'innovations dans les jeux originaux (par exemple Warhammer 3e ou D&D 4e), les \u00e9diteurs reviennent aux bonnes vieilles recettes en les remettant l\u00e9g\u00e8rement au go\u00fbt du jour. C'est pour moi ce qu'a tent\u00e9 de faire Cubicle7 avec la derni\u00e8re \u00e9dition de Warhammer. Enfin, les fans de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition ne seront pas d\u00e9\u00e7u : c'est pareil en mieux. En bonus, le PDF gratuit de conversion de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition \u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me. 28 mars 2024 Du SRD, de l'OGL et de l'ORC ! # Hello et bienvenue aux \u00e9gar\u00e9s qui regardent parfois cette page ! A l'or\u00e9e de ce printemps 2024, je me r\u00e9sous \u00e0 faire une petite bafouille pour... des bookmarks ! Le plus r\u00e9cent : D&D SRD avec bookmarks en fran\u00e7ais en anglais # Bon, certes WotC a publi\u00e9 des documents SRDs en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais, mais les bookmarks ne sont soit pas l\u00e0, soit en vrac. J'ai corrig\u00e9 cela avec une petite publication itch.io : Un PDF en anglais avec tous les bookmarks, Un PDF en fran\u00e7ais avec les bookmarks r\u00e9arrang\u00e9s. En fait, en regardant sur drivethru , des gens font payer le positionnement de bookmarks sur les documents originaux Wizards. C'est certain que cela repr\u00e9sente un certain travail. Mais, comme le contenu (assez important voire \u00e9norme) est gratuit, je trouve \u00e7a un peu mesquin de faire payer les bookmarks, m\u00eame si sans bookmarks, c'est chiant de naviguer dans les PDFs. Bon, enfin, vous avez un truc exploitable pour mobile et tablette, en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Le SRD de D&D 5e # Bon, disons-le, c'est un SRD de bonne facture : +400 pages de trucs, dont tout ce qu'il faut pour joueur \u00e0 D&D 5e en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais ; Les r\u00e8gles et beaucoup de contenu ; Une traduction pas trop nase et vraiment \"officielle\". Petite note : le contenu en mode structur\u00e9 et hypertexte est disponible sur aidedd.org . Encore une fois bravo pour ce travail de mise en ligne gratuite des diff\u00e9rentes sources (basic rules, SRD, etc.) Encore une fois, je tire mon chapeau \u00e0 WotC, m\u00eame si c'est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine avec ses gros d\u00e9fauts (notamment la gestion des talents). Il faut saluer quand m\u00eame cette volont\u00e9 de donner \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9. Les joueurs ne se souviennent pas (ou n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9s), mais c'est pas TSR qui aurait fait \u00e7a ! Et en plus, ils livrent +400 Pages en fran\u00e7ais sans que des gros vilains comme les BBE viennent vous soutirer des sous. Que demande le peuple ? Oui, je n'aime pas les BBE . Ils ne rappellent la mafia de Casus qui faisait la pluie et le beau temps dans le monde r\u00f4listes des ann\u00e9es 80 avec leur ton pourri ironique des \"mecs qui n'assument pas de jouer au JdR et qui doivent absolument tourner tout en d\u00e9rision\" . Heureusement, Descartes \u00e9tait un peu \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart de cette mafia de copains qui, \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 un genre de syst\u00e8me de copinage o\u00f9 certains en \"croquaient\" et d'autres non... Beurk... Pas du tout l'esprit Jeux et Strat\u00e9gies . C'est pourquoi je m'enorgueillis de ne pas avoir un seul BBE dans ma biblioth\u00e8que ! Quand je pense \u00e0 ce qu'ils ont voulu faire \u00e0 WotC avec leur plagiat honteux , je ne suis pas surpris. Bon, enfin, c'est ma compr\u00e9hension de l'incident. Critiquez les m\u00e9chants WotC, bonnes gens, mais regardez dans les faits ceux qui mettent \u00e0 disposition des contenus tr\u00e8s \u00e9pais gratuitement, avec des r\u00e8gles pour faire vos propres produits... 17 mars 2024 Bonne ann\u00e9e 2024 ! # Hello et bonne ann\u00e9e aux \u00e9gar\u00e9s qui regardent parfois cette page ! Licenciements chez Hasbro/WotC # H\u00e9 oui, c'est la mode dans certaines bo\u00eetes am\u00e9ricaines de licencier les gens vers le 15 d\u00e9cembre et c'est ce qu'a fait Hasbro en d\u00e9cembre dernier. Comme vous le savez s\u00fbrement, D&D est une marque de Wizards of the Coast, qui est une filiale de Hasbro, la bo\u00eete qui fait les jouets. En 2023, Hasbro a fait des pertes records dans sa branche entertainment et a donc lanc\u00e9 un grand plan de r\u00e9duction de personnel. Quand on regarde les chiffres, on voit qu'il \u00e9tait difficile de ne pas faire quelque chose. J'ai fait une petite pr\u00e9sentation pour expliquer les choses. Elle est aussi disponible sur le forum de aideDD.org . Bon, certes, virer les gens chez WotC est plut\u00f4t \u00e9trange si on consid\u00e8re que c'est la seule activit\u00e9 en bonne forme \u00e9conomique (quoique, si on y regarde bien, les profits soient constants malgr\u00e9 un chiffre d'affaires en hausse, mais ce peut \u00eatre une indication d'un gros investissement sur le digital). Ce qui me para\u00eet le plus surprenant est le limogeage de Mike Mearls, le co-auteur de D&D 5e, avec Jeremy Crawford. Evidemment, Mike ne travaillait plus sur D&D depuis un petit moment, il travaillait pour Magic the Gathering. OGL, pi\u00e8ge \u00e0 cons ? # Sur le podcast de enworld.org , les intervenants se d\u00e9solaient que D&D soit devenu LE plus gros JDR du monde, loin derri\u00e8re les autres. Je ne vais faire de la critique facile, mais tout \u00e7a, c'est quand m\u00eame d\u00fb \u00e0 la licence OGL... dont beaucoup de gens du milieu du JDR b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient ! Quand WotC publient la version 3 de D&D en OGL, ils font un coup de ma\u00eetre : Ils apparaissent comment des grands seigneurs en ouvrant leur syst\u00e8me de jeu, ainsi que beaucoup de contenu. Ils apparaissent comme des pr\u00e9curseurs en abandonnant des droits d'auteurs et en cr\u00e9ant un march\u00e9, le fameux march\u00e9 du \"D20 Compatible\". Mais, ce que les gens ont du mal \u00e0 comprendre, c'est qu'ils cr\u00e9ent un march\u00e9 de suiveurs , avec qui gens qui sont dans leur sillon. Ils encha\u00eenent ainsi un bon nombre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de jeu tierces : difficile voire impossible de trouver son march\u00e9 sans faire du D20 ; et quand on en fait, on a besoin des 3 manuels de D&D 3e . Avec la version 4, WotC brise les tabous. J'en ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 : ils reviennent \u00e0 un jeu tactique, hyper structur\u00e9, ayant besoin d'un plateau de jeu avec des figurines. La licence OGL devient GSL , un machin plus restrictif qui n'est pas tr\u00e8s simple \u00e0 utiliser. Avec la version 5e de D&D , WotC revient aux fondamentaux de la licence OGL... et encha\u00eene une nouvelle fois toute l'industrie du JDR. D&D 5e, une r\u00e9ussite totale en termes de produit # D&D 5e est une r\u00e9ussite totale en raison, selon votre serviteur, des dimensions suivantes : 1. D&D 5e : le consensus # Le jeu reprend un certain esprit des origines au niveau des r\u00e8gles : Les r\u00e8gles sont simples, beaucoup plus que pour la 3e. Tout n'est pas \u00e9crit, tout n'est pas totalement structur\u00e9, et le tout est assez coh\u00e9rent ; en cela, on retrouve un peu du D&D des origines. Le jeu n'est plus tactique et ne n\u00e9cessite plus forc\u00e9ment un plateau et des figurines. La 5e apporte un certain consensus : les vieux briscards de OD&D et AD&D peuvent s'adapter facilement, les fans de la 3/3.5e ont un petit pas \u00e0 faire pour passer en 5e et les utilisateurs de la 4e peuvent garder leurs sourcebooks et changer facilement de syst\u00e8me. 2. R\u00e8gles compl\u00e8tes gratuites # Les r\u00e8gles de base sont disponibles gratuitement et compl\u00e8tes. Puis sortira le SRD, encore plus gros et encore plus complet. Au niveau des joueurs, il est possible de jouer \u00e0 D&D 5e avec uniquement du mat\u00e9riel gratuit. Cela augmente la pression sur les \u00e9diteurs alternatifs de faire des produits compatibles 5e. Comme les r\u00e8gles (et un gros morceau de contenu) sont disponibles gratuitement, tout pousse les \u00e9diteurs alternatifs \u00e0 ne pas cr\u00e9er de syst\u00e8me de jeu. Un exemple de cela est la licence Lords of the Rings qui n'arrive pas \u00e0 se passer de la 5e : d'abord chez Cubicle 7 avec la s\u00e9rie Adventures in Middle-Earth , puis chez Free League avec Lords of the Rings RPG sur base de la 5e. 3. Une pr\u00e9sence en ligne tous azymuts # La gestion des campagnes est faite en ligne au travers de la Adventurer's Ligue , qui joue le r\u00f4le de play testing grandeur nature.

Conclusion # H\u00e9 oui, avec cette force de frappe et cette pr\u00e9sence tous azymuts, difficile d'\u00e9chapper \u00e0 la grosse Bertha D&D . En d'autres termes, OGL = pi\u00e8ge \u00e0 cons, et comme dit Morrus dans son podcast, la domination de D&D est aujourd'hui bien sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 ce qu'elle \u00e9tait dans les ann\u00e9es 80 ! Reste nos amis de Chaosium qui r\u00e9sistent encore et toujours \u00e0 l'envahisseur avec le Basic Roleplaying System (m\u00eame si ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu modifi\u00e9 dans Call of Cthulhu 7e avec des caract\u00e9ristiques en pourcentage... non reprises dans BRPS 5e). De l'utilisation des IA dans les illustrations de JDR # Bon, l\u00e0, je veux dire, tout le monde est en plein hypocrisie. Ceux qui ont Photoshop savent que le software est blind\u00e9 d'IA. Si on s'int\u00e9resse un peu aux \u00e9coles d'arts, on voit que la ma\u00eetrise des IA type Midjourney ou Dall-E est dans le programme. Donc arr\u00eatez l'hypocrisie : oui, les IA font faire tr\u00e8s mal au m\u00e9tier d'illustrateur sauf si ce dernier se sp\u00e9cialise dans leur utilisation. C'est irr\u00e9versible, et cela touchera le monde du JDR comme les autres mondes : pour des raisons de co\u00fbts. Dans le monde des artistes, cela touchera aussi les pratiques. Mais, ne soyons pas na\u00effs. Cela les touche d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis un moment. On peut toujours faire de la peinture \u00e0 l'huile, mais les illustrateurs d'aujourd'hui ne le font plus parce que c'est trop compliqu\u00e9 et long. Est-ce que demain, les illustrateurs ne seront pas des champions de l'utilisation des IA et de la retouche pour faire l'\u00e9quivalent des belles images faites \u00e0 la main d'aujourd'hui ? Ben si, en fait. Entre nous, m\u00eame dans le monde D&D qui a un standard de qualit\u00e9, toutes les illustrations d'aujourd'hui ne cassent pas trois pattes \u00e0 un canard. There is room for improvement . Alors bien s\u00fbr, quand un artiste se fait injustement accuser de ne pas avoir dessin\u00e9 quelque chose mais qu'on le calomnie sur le net en pr\u00e9tendant le contraire, \u00e7a craint. C'est ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Nestor Ossand\u00f3n \u00e0 propos du dessin ci-dessous. H\u00e9 non, ce n'est fait avec de l'IA. Voir le site de Nestor . Sinon, l'IA, c'est l'\u00e9volution... Est-ce que c'est mieux ou pire, je ne sais pas, mais \u00e7a va changer des choses. Sans compter que les IA ne vont pas causer du souci qu'aux illustrateurs ! L'onde de choc ne fait que d\u00e9marrer. 04 janvier 2024","title":"2024"},{"location":"blog/2024/#cypher-a-eviter","text":"On dit souvent qu'on ne peut pas \u00eatre bon en tout.

Cela part d'un postulat un peu simpliste : \"I am an adjective noun that verbs \", avec : Le nom repr\u00e9sentant la classe/le type de PJ (tous univers), L'adjectif qui est le \"descriptor\" du PJ (tous univers), Le verbe qui est un peu son point fort (sp\u00e9cifique au genre), le \"focus\". J'avoue que repr\u00e9senter tous les types de personnages dans tous les univers par quatre pauvres classes/types de personnages est r\u00e9ellement \u00e9touffant, surtout si l'on consid\u00e8re que le Warrior et l'Explorer ont quand m\u00eame beaucoup en commun (1 seul point de diff\u00e9rence sur les scores par d\u00e9faut !). J'ai fait une petite table dans cet article .

M\u00eame dans le SRD de D&D 5e, nous avons 12 classes de personnages, juste pour faire du D&D ! L\u00e0, quatre classes de personnages dont deux sont presqu'identiques. Ensuite, le fait que les PJs n'aient que 3 caract\u00e9ristiques (Might, Speed, Intellect) renforce ce sentiment de ne pas avoir beaucoup de choix. Dans les JDR g\u00e9n\u00e9riques disponibles, les caract\u00e9ristiques sont plus \u00e9tendes, notamment D&D (6) et Basic Roleplaying (7 voire 8 avec avec la SAN). M\u00eame GURPS en a 4 de base et quelques unes d\u00e9riv\u00e9es. En plus, tout est tr\u00e8s rigide. Les types de personnages n'offrent pas beaucoup de choix dans leur d\u00e9veloppement qui est souvent tr\u00e8s tactique, beaucoup plus que les avantages des classes de D&D . La partie Descriptor me met particuli\u00e8rement en col\u00e8re. Quand on vit dans le monde des JDR, on ne peut pas ne pas conna\u00eetre Risus (1993), Fudge (1995) ou m\u00eame FU (2010). Dans ces trois exemples de jeux, les descriptors sont plus ou moins libres et donnent l'occasion d'une discussion avec le MJ pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des bonus dus au descriptors. Mais dans Cypher, les descriptors sont impos\u00e9s, et ils apportent leur lot d'Abilities (des Skills, des Avantages, des augmentations de pools, des Pouvoirs, etc.) alors m\u00eame que le joueur a fait des choix structurants dans la partie Type de personnage. Difficile donc d'\u00eatre coh\u00e9rent. Il faut revenir en arri\u00e8re aux abilities li\u00e9es au type de PJ. Ne vous inqui\u00e9tez pas, Monte nous refait le coup une seconde fois ! H\u00e9 oui, car il faut maintenant choisir le Focus qui lui aussi apporte son lot d'Abilities. Et donc tout est \u00e0 recommencer. Et je n'aime pas les descriptors impos\u00e9s. Soit, les descriptors sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 du roleplay, souvent pour gagner un avantage quand ces derniers sont applicables, soit il faut utiliser des quantifications. Oui alors, OK, Monte ne voulait pas faire comme les autres, et notamment il ne voulait pas que la cr\u00e9ation de personnage soit \"habituelle\" : caract\u00e9ristiques, puis comp\u00e9tences, puis talents, puis sorts ou psioniques. Il n'emp\u00eache que la promesse initiale d'avoir une cr\u00e9ation de PJ facile est, op\u00e9rationnellement, rat\u00e9e.","title":"Une cr\u00e9ation des PJ confuse"},{"location":"blog/2024/#des-regles-etrangement-compliquees","text":"Il faut aussi comprendre les pools et le r\u00f4le de l'Effort qui est en fait un bonus cach\u00e9 : l'Effort diminue la difficult\u00e9 de 1 et donc octroie un genre de bonus de +3 au d20. Comme le PJ doit diminuer la difficult\u00e9 (je reviendrai sur ce point) plut\u00f4t qu'augmenter ses modificateurs, la m\u00e9canique est invers\u00e9e.

La premi\u00e8re excuse pour cette m\u00e9canique est que les joueurs font tous les jets. En fait, ce n'est pas vrai. De ce que j'ai compris les joueurs font tous les jets durant le combat mais ils n'ont pas \u00e0 faire tous les jets relatifs aux comportements des PNJ, c'est absurde. Les PNJ vont donc se comporter comme le veut le MJ. L'intervention est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme apportant une complication, complication qui doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par un point d'exp\u00e9rience du MJ envers le joueur. On continue dans la confusion totale : quelle exp\u00e9rience a \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9e par le joueur ? Aucune. Est-ce que ce dernier a fait une action h\u00e9ro\u00efque de sorte qu'on le gratifie d'un point de chance/de h\u00e9ros/ de destin/ de force ? Non. This means that the GM uses experience points as a narrative tool. Whenever it seems appropriate, he can introduce complications into the game that affect a specific player, but when he does so, he gives that player 1 XP. C'est grotesque. Et d'abord, comment le MJ sait qu'il est intrusif et non qu'il joue le sc\u00e9nario pr\u00e9vu ? Il se peut qu'une complication soit pr\u00e9vue dans la sc\u00e8ne, c'est m\u00eame g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le cas. Alors les joueurs vont pleurer pour avoir des points d'exp\u00e9rience parce que le MJ apporte des complications ? C'est d\u00e9bile. Cerise sur le g\u00e2teau, le joueur peut refuser l'intrusion en perdant un point d'exp\u00e9rience. Monte indique que c'est peu probable parce que les joueurs ne veulentAn example frequently used in the Numenera rulebook is the appearance of unexpected reinforcements: The GM uses an intrusion and two more chirogs drop out of the leafy canopy above you! Let\u2019s break down the options here: The GM could decide NOT to have any reinforcements up. The GM could decide that the two chirogs are DEFINITELY there and the players have no say about it. The GM could decide that the two chirogs MIGHT be there and use a GM intrusion to negotiate their arrival with the players. A purely traditional RPG only offers the first two options (and those options still exist in Numenera); but the intrusion mechanic offers the third. sans doute pas perdre leurs points. Et donc quoi ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ? Parce que si le jeu \u00e9tait narrativiste, ce serait le joueur qui raconterait comment se d\u00e9roulent les \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Mais l\u00e0, non, il ne fait que choisir, en mode meta-gaming, une option ou une autre. M\u00eame les exemples de Monte sont foireux : GM intrusion is a way to facilitate what goes on in the world outside the characters. Can the minotaur track the PCs\u2019 movements through the maze? Will the fraying rope hold? Pour moi, nous sommes dans du GMing de base. Say the PCs find a hidden console with some buttons. They learn the right order in which to press the buttons, and a section of the floor disappears. As the GM, you don\u2019t ask the players specifically where their characters are standing. Instead, you give a player 1 XP and say, \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re standing directly over this new hole in the floor.\u201d If he wanted, the player could refuse the XP, spend one of his own, and say, \u201cI leap aside to safety.\u201d Most likely, though, he\u2019ll make the defense roll that you call for and let it play out. Donc quoi, pour chaque sc\u00e8ne o\u00f9 il y des complications, pour que les joueurs daignent les accepter, on leur donne des cookies ? There are two ways for the GM to handle this kind of intrusion. You could say, \u201cYou\u2019re standing in the wrong place, so make a roll.\u201d (It\u2019s a Speed defense roll, of course.) Alternatively, you could say, \u201cYou\u2019re standing in the wrong place. The floor opens under your feet, and you fall down into the darkness.\u201d In the first example, the PC has a chance to save himself. In the second example, he doesn\u2019t. Both are viable options. The distinction is based on any number of factors, including the situation, the characters involved, and the needs of the story. This might seem arbitrary or even capricious, but you\u2019re the master of what the intrusion can and can\u2019t do. RPG mechanics need consistency so players can make intelligent decisions based on how they understand the world to work. But they\u2019ll never base their decisions on GM intrusions. They don\u2019t know when intrusions will happen or what form they will take. GM intrusions are the unpredictable and strange twists of fate that affect a person\u2019s life every day. Je ne comprends rien \u00e0 ce long blabla g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et surtout, je ne vois pas ce que \u00e7a apporte (\u00e0 part filer des r\u00e9compenses aux joueurs pour qu'ils acceptent les probl\u00e8mes). Le fait est qu'il y a d'autres moyens que le m\u00e9ta-gaming pour avoir des surprises dans l'intrigue. When player modifications (such as skill, Effort, and so on) determine that success is automatic, the GM can use GM intrusion to negate the automatic success. The player must roll for the action at its original difficulty level or target number 20, whichever is lower. Oui, mais on peut aussi le faire avec un malus circonstanciel qui justifie que l'action ne soit pas automatique. Comme c'est le MJ qui d\u00e9cide du malus, qu'est-ce que \u00e7a change ? Quelle usine \u00e0 gaz pour rien ! Sans compter que cela rajoute un aspect grippe-sous chez les joueurs qui doivent attendre avec avidit\u00e9 toutes les interventions n\u00e9gatives du MJ en disant que c'est une intrusion. J'ai lu l'article sur The Alexandrian sur les GM intrusions, mais je ne suis pas convaincu. La plupart des jeux proposent des m\u00e9caniques de complications suite \u00e0 des \u00e9checs critiques. Si vous jouez \u00e0 AD&D 1e, vous savez que Gygax avait de nombreuses tables al\u00e9atoires \u00e0 tiroirs pour apporter un peu de surprise dans les sc\u00e9narios, que ce soit aux joueurs ou au MD. Voici un exemple pris sur The Alexandrian : An example frequently used in the Numenera rulebook is the appearance of unexpected reinforcements: The GM uses an intrusion and two more chirogs drop out of the leafy canopy above you! Let\u2019s break down the options here: -The GM could decide NOT to have any reinforcements up. -The GM could decide that the two chirogs are DEFINITELY there and the players have no say about it. -The GM could decide that the two chirogs MIGHT be there and use a GM intrusion to negotiate their arrival with the players. A purely traditional RPG only offers the first two options (and those options still exist in Numenera); but the intrusion mechanic offers the third. Mais pas du tout. Dans beaucoup de sc\u00e9narios, le MJ a une table des rencontres ou il a un certain pourcentage de chances que les choses se passent. S'il juge m\u00eame \u00e0 la vol\u00e9e, en fonction de la tension autour de la table, il n'interrompt pas le jeu pour laisser voir la m\u00e9canique et casser l'ambiance. Peut-\u00eatre ai-je trop jou\u00e9 \u00e0 CoC mais je ne me vois pas du tout faire \u00e7a quand l'ambiance est install\u00e9e. De plus, je trouve cela tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9tentieux de la part du MJ, car les joueurs, normalement, dans le monde du JDR, font ce qu'ils veulent. Ils ont donc de multiples occasions de cr\u00e9er de la surprise et de solliciter la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 du MJ (sauf dans un donjon super cadr\u00e9 bien s\u00fbr). Un autre exemple pris par The Alexandrian est d'utiliser cette m\u00e9canique pour compenser les d\u00e9faillances des r\u00e8gles. L\u00e0, les bras m'en tombent. Comme si le MJ ne pouvait pas g\u00e9rer \u00e7a sans meta-gaming. Une chose est certaine : le m\u00e9ta-gaming n'est vraiment pas mon truc. Tout comme les jeux type PbtA.

Finalement, j'ai repris la lecture du bouquin de r\u00e8gles en PDF, en anglais cette fois, avec des petites incursions dans le bouquin papier fran\u00e7ais qui est quand m\u00eame un beau bidule bien lourd. Je ne dis pas que je ne ferai pas jouer les petits sc\u00e9narios du Starter Set . J'en ai trouv\u00e9 une version physique pas cher sur Vinted . C'est mieux pour les cartes. Il me reste \u00e0 trouver le bouquin de r\u00e8gles en anglais, parce que, j'ai de plus en plus de mal \u00e0 me faire aux traductions. Enfin, les joueurs d'aujourd'hui ne se rendent pas compte : les bouquins sont hyper-luxueux et le contenu est quand m\u00eame souvent de grande qualit\u00e9. Quand je vois les vieux jeux, les Grands Anciens comme dirait HPL, je suis impressionn\u00e9 par la qualit\u00e9 : Warhammer v4 est un tr\u00e8s bon jeu tr\u00e8s facile d'acc\u00e8s et toujours aussi exp\u00e9ditif dans les combats (notamment avec la m\u00e9canique d'avantage). D&D 5e est un tr\u00e8s bon compromis entre du vieux et du nouveau, il est moins tactique que la 4e mais reste assez proche de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition d'AD&D. Call of Cthulhu 7e, c'est toujours du CoC malgr\u00e9 le fait que les caract\u00e9ristiques soient devenues des pourcentages (mais pourquoi ?) J'ai acquis en occase Runequest 4e en anglais et l\u00e0 encore, on est dans le super classique. Quand on a v\u00e9cu les premi\u00e8res \u00e9ditions de tout cela, et les remakes plus ou moins foireux, on est content de ce qui sort aujourd'hui (m\u00eame si \u00e7a co\u00fbte toujours beaucoup de sous). A la r\u00e9flexion, c'est sans doute un truc de vieux. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait plein d'innovations dans les jeux originaux (par exemple Warhammer 3e ou D&D 4e), les \u00e9diteurs reviennent aux bonnes vieilles recettes en les remettant l\u00e9g\u00e8rement au go\u00fbt du jour. C'est pour moi ce qu'a tent\u00e9 de faire Cubicle7 avec la derni\u00e8re \u00e9dition de Warhammer. Enfin, les fans de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition ne seront pas d\u00e9\u00e7u : c'est pareil en mieux.

Donc arr\u00eatez l'hypocrisie : oui, les IA font faire tr\u00e8s mal au m\u00e9tier d'illustrateur sauf si ce dernier se sp\u00e9cialise dans leur utilisation.

Ci-dessous est la classification des pouvoirs par caract\u00e9ristique due l'on trouve dans Alternity , le jeu de SF de WotC lanc\u00e9 puis abandonn\u00e9 peu apr\u00e8s son rachat de TSR au profit de toute la gamme d20, notamment le d20 Modern et d20 Future . Bref, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 int\u00e9ressant de la conception est que les pouvoirs sont rattach\u00e9s \u00e0 une caract\u00e9ristique diff\u00e9rente, alors que dans les syst\u00e8mes \u00e9mulant la magie, on se retrouve vite avec la caract\u00e9ristique Wisdom ou Intelligence comme base de tous les bonus. D&D 5e a un peu vari\u00e9 cette unicit\u00e9 de caract\u00e9ristique entre les diff\u00e9rentes classes de personnages (par exemple le Barde utilisant le Charisma pour la magie) mais sinon, cette affectation des pouvoirs \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques est int\u00e9ressante car elle peut m\u00eame permettre de n'avoir que des personnages \"psychistes\" mais dont les points forts sont sur diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques. Le syst\u00e8me d' Alternity est assez int\u00e9ressant. Bien s\u00fbr, le psychiste poss\u00e8de des points d'\u00e9nergie psionique \u00e9gaux \u00e0 sa Will, ce qui rappelle le syst\u00e8me de magie de BRP avec les points de magie \u00e9gaux au Power. Petite innovation, ce nombre de points peut \u00eatre multipli\u00e9 par un facteur 0.5 si le personnage n'est pas uniquement un psychiste et 1.5 s'il est un Fraal . Mais c'est dans le syst\u00e8me de combat que se situe la partie int\u00e9ressante. Certes, si un psychiste utilise la t\u00e9l\u00e9kin\u00e9sie pour se battre ou un autre pouvoir psychique, nous revenons \u00e0 du classique avec un combat \u00e0 mains nues, en m\u00eal\u00e9e ou \u00e0 distance. Mais quand le combat se d\u00e9roule sur le plan psychique, Alternity distingue trois cas : Les assauts, Les subversions, les pi\u00e8ges. Le syst\u00e8me en lui-m\u00eame n'est pas g\u00e9nial. Les assauts font l'objet d'un jet de comp\u00e9tence psy avec comme modificateurs en gros la r\u00e9sistance du personnage attaqu\u00e9 (modificateur de Will). Ce dernier peut potentiellement \"parer\" mentalement s'il poss\u00e8de Mind Shield. Si le coup est gagnant, le d\u00e9fenseur peut r\u00e9duire les points perdus en utilisant Psychic Armor. Mouais. Le probl\u00e8me de ce syst\u00e8me est qu'il n'est pas tr\u00e8s homog\u00e8ne. Dans certaines versions de D&D , le syst\u00e8me assume d'aller un peu plus loin avec une Psychic Armor Class, ce qui fait que tous les personnages peuvent \u00eatre concern\u00e9s. L\u00e0, juste ceux qui ont les caract\u00e9ristiques peuvent se d\u00e9fendre activement. Gygax avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tent\u00e9 de contourner ce probl\u00e8me, m\u00eame si son syst\u00e8me dans D&D 0e n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s lisible. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que le personnage progresse dans l'acquisition de pouvoirs, ils gagne des attaques et des d\u00e9fenses psychiques. Les subversions sont des genres d'assauts destin\u00e9s \u00e0 affaiblir l'opposant. Les pi\u00e8ges sont un concept int\u00e9ressant, sachant que la victime doit cumuler un certain nombre des succ\u00e8s pour s'en sortir. Cela ressemble un peu aux r\u00e8gles de M\u00e9ga 2 pour se sortir d'un transfert. Bref, ce bouquin n'a pas marqu\u00e9 l'histoire mais je retiens deux id\u00e9es int\u00e9ressantes : Les pouvoirs sont associ\u00e9s \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques, Les combats psychiques peuvent \u00eatre \"typ\u00e9s\". 10 mai 2025 Relativit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me d100 du BRP de Chaosium # En compl\u00e9ment de la page sur les moteurs de jeux de r\u00f4le g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , notons que le moteur de jeu d100 BRP de Chaosium est b\u00e2ti sur des hypoth\u00e8ses plus dures pour les PJs que le syst\u00e8me D&D .

Arkane Asylum est en train de traduire le jeu et propose d\u00e9j\u00e0 les quick starters en fran\u00e7ais. Une campagne de financement va \u00eatre bient\u00f4t lanc\u00e9e. J'avais t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 voil\u00e0 quelques temps le quick start et j'avoue que je n'avais pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu. Un jeu de plus OSR. Dans la vid\u00e9o, les protagonistes expliquent quelques sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s du jeu : les torches ont une dur\u00e9e de vie d'une heure et aucun PJ ne voit dans le noir, la progression a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 al\u00e9atoire, la cr\u00e9ation des personnages est un peu celle des personnages de niveau z\u00e9ro de DCC , etc. Le jeu en lui-m\u00eame, dans sa version compl\u00e8te, propose plein de tables al\u00e9atoires. Le jeu est facile \u00e0 prendre en mains mais la question est : au del\u00e0 du fait que le jeu ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par une am\u00e9ricaine assez bonne communiquante et assez dou\u00e9e, qu'est-ce que ce jeu apporte ? Une ambiance sp\u00e9ciale ? Mouais. Peut-\u00eatre une facilit\u00e9 \u00e0 jouer en solo. Pourquoi l'OSR ? # Nous avons beaucoup \u00e9crit sur l' OGL ( Open Gaming License ) qui a permis le mouvement OSR ( Old School Revival ). L'OSR, pour moi a eu trois phases : 2000 : l'explosion l'OGL sort et c'est l'explosion des contenus OSR. Wizards of the Coast ne poursuivra pas les gamers qui produisent du contenu \u00e0 partir des r\u00e8gles de D&D . Cet OSR retournera \u00e0 des jeux plus proches des originaux, simplifi\u00e9s ou non, en r\u00e9action, en quelque sorte \u00e0 D&D 3.0/3.5 . 2008 : le renforcement la sortie de D&D 4e renforce le mouvement OSR dans la mesure o\u00f9 D&D est devenu un jeu de plateau tr\u00e8s technique, un peu \u00e0 contre-courant de la tendance du march\u00e9. 2014 : le fin des haricots la sortie de D&D 5e va tuer l'OSR. D&D est devenu un jeu tr\u00e8s simple, gardant des parties de la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9dition mais de mani\u00e8re simplifi\u00e9e et coupl\u00e9 avec un contenu \u00e9norme et de belles campagnes. 2024 : le coup de gr\u00e2ce La sortie de D&D 5.5e en 2024 va finir de l'achever. Le jeu est propre, bien organis\u00e9, simple, facile \u00e0 prendre en mains, rod\u00e9 sur des milliers de tables. Donc en 2025, quel est l'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 se tourner de nouveau vers l'OSR ? Au niveau des r\u00e8gles, pas grand chose. Au niveau prix, nous sommes dans des prix d\u00e9passant les 50$ avec certes pas mal de contenus. Mais d'autres syst\u00e8mes sont disponibles gratuitement comme le Black Sword Hack , syst\u00e8mes que, pour ma part, je ne trouve pas super emballants. J'ai aussi dans ma biblioth\u00e8que le White Hack : bof. Je ne suis pas vendu \u00e0 WotC, mais leurs produits sont quand m\u00eame assez jolis, m\u00eame si nous gardons un petit c\u00f4t\u00e9 Woke qui me g\u00eane un peu (Pathfinder 2e est un peu plus roots dans le style), qui plus est dans certaines campagnes, j'y reviendrai un jour. Mais bon, au niveau syst\u00e8me de jeu, les free rules sont quand m\u00eame un bel exercice de clarification permettant de jouer dans pas mal d'univers, y compris des univers de fantasy un peu dark. Je reste toujours un peu perplexe quant aux paraphrases : elles veulent apporter des choses mais souvent, l'original est mieux. J'aurais compris si Shadowdark avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un suppl\u00e9ment pour la 5.5e avec une atmosph\u00e8re sp\u00e9ciale, une interpr\u00e9tation des r\u00e8gles, plein de tables et de fa\u00e7ons de jouer en solo. Mais \u00e0 quoi bon refaire, une fois encore, longtemps apr\u00e8s la bataille, les r\u00e8gles de D&D 5e ? A propos du lien Classe d'Armure et D20 # La CA, un concept composite # Je me suis souvent demand\u00e9 quelle \u00e9tait le concept derri\u00e8re la classe d'Armure de D&D , AC en fran\u00e7ais et CA en anglais. Mais, depuis quelques temps, \u00e0 l'occasion de la finalisation de la traduction de Troika! , je me suis pos\u00e9 des questions de game design , j'ai lu pas mal de choses et les choses se sont \u00e9clair\u00e9es. (En fait, la traduction est termin\u00e9e depuis longtemps, elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par une IA, mais j'avais encore quelques retouches \u00e0 faire et je ne trouve pas le temps de la finaliser.) Je faisais des recherches sur les syst\u00e8mes D6. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas mal \u00e9crit sur ces sujets dans ces pages (sur les syst\u00e8mes , sur le combat et sur les seuils de difficult\u00e9 ). Le premier doute que j'ai eu \u00e9tait relatif au syst\u00e8me de combat de Risus, syst\u00e8me dans lequel des clich\u00e9s en nombre de D6 peuvent s'affronter. Il s'av\u00e8re qu'un d\u00e9calage de 1D, par exemple un clich\u00e9 \u00e0 3D contre un clich\u00e9 \u00e0 4D, g\u00e9n\u00e8re des probabilit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s peu en faveur du clich\u00e9 le plus faible. J'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 remarqu\u00e9 \u00e7a dans le syst\u00e8me D6, et dans Star Wars , il y a des ann\u00e9es. Un d\u00e9calage faible dans la mesure des comp\u00e9tences implique une diff\u00e9rence de probabilit\u00e9s forte dans le jeu, ce qui pose un probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9quilibre. Ces r\u00e9flexions m'ont men\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment vers la notion de CA de D&D . En effet, dans D&D , l'attaquant ne fait pas de duel mais joue contre un facteur de difficult\u00e9 fixe, la CA. Outre le fait que le jeu soit plus rapide, cette CA cumule plusieurs concepts : L'armure et les boucliers, La dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 et donc la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre touch\u00e9 (sous-entendu les esquives et parades), Les diverses protections suppl\u00e9mentaires, notamment magiques, Les circonstances du combat (dans AD&D 1e , la CA du bouclier (+1) ne compte que si le PJ fait face \u00e0 l'adversaire). Lorsque le jet de D20 est sup\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal \u00e0 la CA, l'adversaire prend des dommages et perd des points de vie (PdV). Il faut noter que, m\u00eame au premier niveau, les personnages peuvent blesser des monstres tr\u00e8s puissants, car la CA est en quelque sorte \"born\u00e9e\" et les r\u00e8gles suivantes sont appliqu\u00e9es : Une CA de 20 est atteignable par tous et peu de monstres d\u00e9passent la CA de 20 ; Un monstre est difficile \u00e0 tuer s'il a une haute CA (dans D&D 5e ) et s'il a beaucoup de PdV. Ainsi la CA va avec la progression des PdV, ce qui est vrai pour les monstres mais aussi pour les PJs. D'o\u00f9 les niveaux. M\u00eame s'il n'a pas pour but d'\u00eatre simulationniste, mais plut\u00f4t logique et efficace, le concept de CA a \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup d\u00e9cri\u00e9, si bien qu'il n'est pas tr\u00e8s courant de le voir impl\u00e9ment\u00e9 dans des jeux plus r\u00e9cents. Pourtant, il perdure et je vais donner une possible explication quant \u00e0 sa dur\u00e9e de vie exceptionnelle. Deux types de combats # Dans D&D , l'attaque dans le combat est r\u00e9solue en un seul jet : 1D20 + modificateurs contre la CA. C'est une m\u00e9canique de seuil. Ce seuil est la plupart du temps statique, la CA \u00e9tant not\u00e9e sur la feuille de personnage. La plupart des autres jeux vont proposer deux jets , un pour l'attaquant et un pour le d\u00e9fenseur. Dans la plupart de ces syst\u00e8mes, le vainqueur de l'attaque inflige des dommages au vaincu et ce dernier subit une perte de PdV qui est temp\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'armure qu'il porte, armure qui absorbe tout ou partie de la perte. Les jeux proposant cette m\u00e9canique de \"duel\" sont souvent plus compliqu\u00e9s, plus lourds, et plus meurtriers : Plus compliqu\u00e9s d'abord parce qu'en plus des deux jets et du d\u00e9compte complexe de PdV, les concepteurs rajoutent souvent des fioritures simulationnistes (parade, esquive, localisation des blessures, armures localis\u00e9es sur le personnage, armures ayant aussi des PdV et \u00e9tant ab\u00eem\u00e9es par des coups absorb\u00e9s, armures au potentiel de protection repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par des jets de d\u00e9s, etc.) ; Plus lourds, parce qu'au final, le combat interrompt le jeu plus longtemps et tous les joueurs ne sont pas forc\u00e9ment passionn\u00e9s par ces phases (m\u00eame si les MJs le sont) ; Plus meurtriers car pouvant cumuler une r\u00e9ussite critique chez l'attaquant avec un \u00e9chec critique chez le d\u00e9fenseur, ce qui peut occasionner la mort instantan\u00e9e d'un PJ, r\u00e9sultat d'une action purement al\u00e9atoire. La l\u00e9talit\u00e9 des combats est adapt\u00e9e un certain type de jeu et de joueurs, mais force est de constater que la mort d'un PJ due uniquement \u00e0 l'al\u00e9a a quelque chose d'anti-jeu-de-r\u00f4les, car elle ne r\u00e9sulte pas de l'action directe des PJs. Ou plut\u00f4t, elle va d\u00e9courager les combats et donc \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 des jeux plus modernes o\u00f9 les combats faciaux sont l\u00e9taux, mais pas \u00e0 des mondes de high fantasy . Deux types de syst\u00e8mes de magie # Nous pouvons constater le m\u00eame type de dichotomie avec les syst\u00e8mes de magie. Dans D&D , le magicien lance un certain nombre de sorts par jour, mais il ne lance pas les d\u00e9s pour les lancer : le succ\u00e8s est automatique. Le d\u00e9fenseur fait, lui, un jet de sauvegarde contre le niveau magique du magicien et du sort. C'est encore une m\u00e9canique de seuil \u00e0 simple jet. Dans la plupart des autres jeux, nous avons deux jets : le magicien doit r\u00e9ussir son jet pour r\u00e9ussir son sort, et le d\u00e9fenseur peut faire aussi un jet de sauvegarde. C'est le cas de la plupart de syst\u00e8mes de magie de BRP . Les chances de r\u00e9ussite sont donc tr\u00e8s amoindries, et il reste frustrant pour le joueur d'\u00e9chouer sur un sort basique alors qu'il poss\u00e8de 75% de chances de r\u00e9ussite. C'est encore une m\u00e9canique de duel \u00e0 deux jets. CA et D20 # D&D est donc bien un jeu plus simple et plus efficace que les jeux impl\u00e9mentant un double jet, moins simulationniste et plus adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 de la high fantasy . Pour en revenir \u00e0 la CA, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le jeu rend la plupart des monstres \"atteignables\" \u00e0 tous les joueurs de tous les niveaux en raison de leur CA ne d\u00e9passant qu'exceptionnellement 20 (un jet de 20 en attaque a 5% de chances de se produire, cela sans compter les bonus divers), il est donc requis que la chance de toucher un monstre ayant une CA de 20, ne soit pas nulle. Or, si nous voulons atteindre un seuil S avec de multiples D6, comme 3D6 pour atteindre S=18, il est n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer l'effet courbe en cloche des probabilit\u00e9s. Pour avoir 5% de chances d'atteindre ou de d\u00e9passer un seuil S le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 possible avec 3D6, il faut S=16. Avec 2D6, nous n'avons pas cette finesse : moins de 3% de chances de faire 12 et plus de 8% de chances de faire 11 ou plus. Force est de constater qu'introduire de l'al\u00e9a avec les d\u00e9s poly\u00e9driques classiques (D6, D8, D10, D12, D20) dans le but de d\u00e9passer un seuil S avec environ 5% de chances de r\u00e9ussite, la lin\u00e9arit\u00e9 des probabilit\u00e9s du D20 (5% \u00e0 chaque pas) l'assure. Elle permet de garantir que les PJs de bas niveau pourront toucher des CA \u00e9lev\u00e9es et porter des dommages, et donc contribuer \u00e0 un combat contre un adversaire tr\u00e8s puissant, tout comme les PJs de haut niveau. La m\u00e9canique D20 + CA est donc \u00e0 la fois efficace, robuste car fonctionnant avec tous les niveaux, et au final amusante, car elle n'exclue pas les joueurs de faible niveau. Introduire la CA dans des jeux \u00e0 duels ? # Dans les jeux de la gamme D6 , les choses ne sont pas simples, ne serait-ce que parce la probabilit\u00e9 de faire des grands chiffres est faible (courbe en cloche). Cela ouvre aussi une perspective un peu diff\u00e9rente sur l'immense litt\u00e9rature \"D20\" qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la sortie de la premi\u00e8re licence OGL, et le fait que beaucoup de jeux aux r\u00e8gles diff\u00e9rentes ont fait une version D20. Il faudrait prendre le temps de comparer avec les syst\u00e8mes d'origine. Conclusion # Il manquait la conclusion \u00e0 cet article. Si l'on veut un jeu amusant dans lequel chaque joueur, quelque soit son niveau, peut avoir une chance de toucher un adversaire, il faut donc que la \"r\u00e9sistance\" totale de cet adversaire soit un seuil fixe atteignable par tous. Si nous mettons ce seuil \u00e0 un pur al\u00e9a, non modifi\u00e9 par des bonus ou des malus, que nous fixons une valeur arbitraire \u00e0 5%, le d20 para\u00eet le meilleur choix (20 est toujours un succ\u00e8s, critique de surcro\u00eet). Les cr\u00e9atures doivent avoir un seuil fixe pour \u00eatre touch\u00e9 et ce seuil repr\u00e9sente une difficult\u00e9 major\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 tous de toucher et de porter des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. Les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts et les points de vie g\u00e9reront le delta de niveau entre les personnages et les monstres. Il faut donc voir que le couple d20+CA est d'une rare puissance en termes de m\u00e9canique de jeu, et les deux m\u00e9canismes sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s. Nous parlons bien de jeu ici et non pas d'une m\u00e9canique simulationniste. Ce couple est efficace, rapide et amusant, et cela explique certainement sa p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 au travers des diverses \u00e9ditions de D&D . 08 avril 2025","title":"2025"},{"location":"blog/2025/#les-pouvoirs-psy-dans-alternity-1999","text":"Je continue dans l'exploration des syst\u00e8mes psioniques apr\u00e8s ma traduction des pouvoirs psychiques de D&D 0e . Ci-dessous est la classification des pouvoirs par caract\u00e9ristique due l'on trouve dans Alternity , le jeu de SF de WotC lanc\u00e9 puis abandonn\u00e9 peu apr\u00e8s son rachat de TSR au profit de toute la gamme d20, notamment le d20 Modern et d20 Future . Bref, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 int\u00e9ressant de la conception est que les pouvoirs sont rattach\u00e9s \u00e0 une caract\u00e9ristique diff\u00e9rente, alors que dans les syst\u00e8mes \u00e9mulant la magie, on se retrouve vite avec la caract\u00e9ristique Wisdom ou Intelligence comme base de tous les bonus. D&D 5e a un peu vari\u00e9 cette unicit\u00e9 de caract\u00e9ristique entre les diff\u00e9rentes classes de personnages (par exemple le Barde utilisant le Charisma pour la magie) mais sinon, cette affectation des pouvoirs \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques est int\u00e9ressante car elle peut m\u00eame permettre de n'avoir que des personnages \"psychistes\" mais dont les points forts sont sur diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques. Le syst\u00e8me d' Alternity est assez int\u00e9ressant. Bien s\u00fbr, le psychiste poss\u00e8de des points d'\u00e9nergie psionique \u00e9gaux \u00e0 sa Will, ce qui rappelle le syst\u00e8me de magie de BRP avec les points de magie \u00e9gaux au Power. Petite innovation, ce nombre de points peut \u00eatre multipli\u00e9 par un facteur 0.5 si le personnage n'est pas uniquement un psychiste et 1.5 s'il est un Fraal . Mais c'est dans le syst\u00e8me de combat que se situe la partie int\u00e9ressante. Certes, si un psychiste utilise la t\u00e9l\u00e9kin\u00e9sie pour se battre ou un autre pouvoir psychique, nous revenons \u00e0 du classique avec un combat \u00e0 mains nues, en m\u00eal\u00e9e ou \u00e0 distance. Mais quand le combat se d\u00e9roule sur le plan psychique, Alternity distingue trois cas : Les assauts, Les subversions, les pi\u00e8ges. Le syst\u00e8me en lui-m\u00eame n'est pas g\u00e9nial. Les assauts font l'objet d'un jet de comp\u00e9tence psy avec comme modificateurs en gros la r\u00e9sistance du personnage attaqu\u00e9 (modificateur de Will). Ce dernier peut potentiellement \"parer\" mentalement s'il poss\u00e8de Mind Shield. Si le coup est gagnant, le d\u00e9fenseur peut r\u00e9duire les points perdus en utilisant Psychic Armor. Mouais. Le probl\u00e8me de ce syst\u00e8me est qu'il n'est pas tr\u00e8s homog\u00e8ne. Dans certaines versions de D&D , le syst\u00e8me assume d'aller un peu plus loin avec une Psychic Armor Class, ce qui fait que tous les personnages peuvent \u00eatre concern\u00e9s. L\u00e0, juste ceux qui ont les caract\u00e9ristiques peuvent se d\u00e9fendre activement. Gygax avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tent\u00e9 de contourner ce probl\u00e8me, m\u00eame si son syst\u00e8me dans D&D 0e n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s lisible. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que le personnage progresse dans l'acquisition de pouvoirs, ils gagne des attaques et des d\u00e9fenses psychiques. Les subversions sont des genres d'assauts destin\u00e9s \u00e0 affaiblir l'opposant. Les pi\u00e8ges sont un concept int\u00e9ressant, sachant que la victime doit cumuler un certain nombre des succ\u00e8s pour s'en sortir. Cela ressemble un peu aux r\u00e8gles de M\u00e9ga 2 pour se sortir d'un transfert. Bref, ce bouquin n'a pas marqu\u00e9 l'histoire mais je retiens deux id\u00e9es int\u00e9ressantes : Les pouvoirs sont associ\u00e9s \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes caract\u00e9ristiques, Les combats psychiques peuvent \u00eatre \"typ\u00e9s\". 10 mai 2025","title":"Les pouvoirs psy dans Alternity (1999)"},{"location":"blog/2025/#relativite-du-systeme-d100-du-brp-de-chaosium","text":"En compl\u00e9ment de la page sur les moteurs de jeux de r\u00f4le g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , notons que le moteur de jeu d100 BRP de Chaosium est b\u00e2ti sur des hypoth\u00e8ses plus dures pour les PJs que le syst\u00e8me D&D .

L'OSR, pour moi a eu trois phases : 2000 : l'explosion l'OGL sort et c'est l'explosion des contenus OSR. Wizards of the Coast ne poursuivra pas les gamers qui produisent du contenu \u00e0 partir des r\u00e8gles de D&D . Cet OSR retournera \u00e0 des jeux plus proches des originaux, simplifi\u00e9s ou non, en r\u00e9action, en quelque sorte \u00e0 D&D 3.0/3.5 . 2008 : le renforcement la sortie de D&D 4e renforce le mouvement OSR dans la mesure o\u00f9 D&D est devenu un jeu de plateau tr\u00e8s technique, un peu \u00e0 contre-courant de la tendance du march\u00e9. 2014 : le fin des haricots la sortie de D&D 5e va tuer l'OSR. D&D est devenu un jeu tr\u00e8s simple, gardant des parties de la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9dition mais de mani\u00e8re simplifi\u00e9e et coupl\u00e9 avec un contenu \u00e9norme et de belles campagnes. 2024 : le coup de gr\u00e2ce La sortie de D&D 5.5e en 2024 va finir de l'achever. Le jeu est propre, bien organis\u00e9, simple, facile \u00e0 prendre en mains, rod\u00e9 sur des milliers de tables. Donc en 2025, quel est l'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 se tourner de nouveau vers l'OSR ? Au niveau des r\u00e8gles, pas grand chose. Au niveau prix, nous sommes dans des prix d\u00e9passant les 50$ avec certes pas mal de contenus. Mais d'autres syst\u00e8mes sont disponibles gratuitement comme le Black Sword Hack , syst\u00e8mes que, pour ma part, je ne trouve pas super emballants. J'ai aussi dans ma biblioth\u00e8que le White Hack : bof. Je ne suis pas vendu \u00e0 WotC, mais leurs produits sont quand m\u00eame assez jolis, m\u00eame si nous gardons un petit c\u00f4t\u00e9 Woke qui me g\u00eane un peu (Pathfinder 2e est un peu plus roots dans le style), qui plus est dans certaines campagnes, j'y reviendrai un jour. Mais bon, au niveau syst\u00e8me de jeu, les free rules sont quand m\u00eame un bel exercice de clarification permettant de jouer dans pas mal d'univers, y compris des univers de fantasy un peu dark. Je reste toujours un peu perplexe quant aux paraphrases : elles veulent apporter des choses mais souvent, l'original est mieux. J'aurais compris si Shadowdark avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un suppl\u00e9ment pour la 5.5e avec une atmosph\u00e8re sp\u00e9ciale, une interpr\u00e9tation des r\u00e8gles, plein de tables et de fa\u00e7ons de jouer en solo.

Mais, depuis quelques temps, \u00e0 l'occasion de la finalisation de la traduction de Troika! , je me suis pos\u00e9 des questions de game design , j'ai lu pas mal de choses et les choses se sont \u00e9clair\u00e9es. (En fait, la traduction est termin\u00e9e depuis longtemps, elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par une IA, mais j'avais encore quelques retouches \u00e0 faire et je ne trouve pas le temps de la finaliser.) Je faisais des recherches sur les syst\u00e8mes D6. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas mal \u00e9crit sur ces sujets dans ces pages (sur les syst\u00e8mes , sur le combat et sur les seuils de difficult\u00e9 ). Le premier doute que j'ai eu \u00e9tait relatif au syst\u00e8me de combat de Risus, syst\u00e8me dans lequel des clich\u00e9s en nombre de D6 peuvent s'affronter. Il s'av\u00e8re qu'un d\u00e9calage de 1D, par exemple un clich\u00e9 \u00e0 3D contre un clich\u00e9 \u00e0 4D, g\u00e9n\u00e8re des probabilit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s peu en faveur du clich\u00e9 le plus faible. J'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 remarqu\u00e9 \u00e7a dans le syst\u00e8me D6, et dans Star Wars , il y a des ann\u00e9es. Un d\u00e9calage faible dans la mesure des comp\u00e9tences implique une diff\u00e9rence de probabilit\u00e9s forte dans le jeu, ce qui pose un probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9quilibre. Ces r\u00e9flexions m'ont men\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment vers la notion de CA de D&D . En effet, dans D&D , l'attaquant ne fait pas de duel mais joue contre un facteur de difficult\u00e9 fixe, la CA. Outre le fait que le jeu soit plus rapide, cette CA cumule plusieurs concepts : L'armure et les boucliers, La dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 et donc la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre touch\u00e9 (sous-entendu les esquives et parades), Les diverses protections suppl\u00e9mentaires, notamment magiques, Les circonstances du combat (dans AD&D 1e , la CA du bouclier (+1) ne compte que si le PJ fait face \u00e0 l'adversaire). Lorsque le jet de D20 est sup\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal \u00e0 la CA, l'adversaire prend des dommages et perd des points de vie (PdV). Il faut noter que, m\u00eame au premier niveau, les personnages peuvent blesser des monstres tr\u00e8s puissants, car la CA est en quelque sorte \"born\u00e9e\" et les r\u00e8gles suivantes sont appliqu\u00e9es : Une CA de 20 est atteignable par tous et peu de monstres d\u00e9passent la CA de 20 ; Un monstre est difficile \u00e0 tuer s'il a une haute CA (dans D&D 5e ) et s'il a beaucoup de PdV. Ainsi la CA va avec la progression des PdV, ce qui est vrai pour les monstres mais aussi pour les PJs. D'o\u00f9 les niveaux. M\u00eame s'il n'a pas pour but d'\u00eatre simulationniste, mais plut\u00f4t logique et efficace, le concept de CA a \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup d\u00e9cri\u00e9, si bien qu'il n'est pas tr\u00e8s courant de le voir impl\u00e9ment\u00e9 dans des jeux plus r\u00e9cents. Pourtant, il perdure et je vais donner une possible explication quant \u00e0 sa dur\u00e9e de vie exceptionnelle.","title":"La CA, un concept composite"},{"location":"blog/2025/#deux-types-de-combats","text":"Dans D&D , l'attaque dans le combat est r\u00e9solue en un seul jet : 1D20 + modificateurs contre la CA. C'est une m\u00e9canique de seuil. Ce seuil est la plupart du temps statique, la CA \u00e9tant not\u00e9e sur la feuille de personnage. La plupart des autres jeux vont proposer deux jets , un pour l'attaquant et un pour le d\u00e9fenseur. Dans la plupart de ces syst\u00e8mes, le vainqueur de l'attaque inflige des dommages au vaincu et ce dernier subit une perte de PdV qui est temp\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'armure qu'il porte, armure qui absorbe tout ou partie de la perte. Les jeux proposant cette m\u00e9canique de \"duel\" sont souvent plus compliqu\u00e9s, plus lourds, et plus meurtriers : Plus compliqu\u00e9s d'abord parce qu'en plus des deux jets et du d\u00e9compte complexe de PdV, les concepteurs rajoutent souvent des fioritures simulationnistes (parade, esquive, localisation des blessures, armures localis\u00e9es sur le personnage, armures ayant aussi des PdV et \u00e9tant ab\u00eem\u00e9es par des coups absorb\u00e9s, armures au potentiel de protection repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par des jets de d\u00e9s, etc.) ; Plus lourds, parce qu'au final, le combat interrompt le jeu plus longtemps et tous les joueurs ne sont pas forc\u00e9ment passionn\u00e9s par ces phases (m\u00eame si les MJs le sont) ; Plus meurtriers car pouvant cumuler une r\u00e9ussite critique chez l'attaquant avec un \u00e9chec critique chez le d\u00e9fenseur, ce qui peut occasionner la mort instantan\u00e9e d'un PJ, r\u00e9sultat d'une action purement al\u00e9atoire. La l\u00e9talit\u00e9 des combats est adapt\u00e9e un certain type de jeu et de joueurs, mais force est de constater que la mort d'un PJ due uniquement \u00e0 l'al\u00e9a a quelque chose d'anti-jeu-de-r\u00f4les, car elle ne r\u00e9sulte pas de l'action directe des PJs. Ou plut\u00f4t, elle va d\u00e9courager les combats et donc \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 des jeux plus modernes o\u00f9 les combats faciaux sont l\u00e9taux, mais pas \u00e0 des mondes de high fantasy .","title":"Deux types de combats"},{"location":"blog/2025/#deux-types-de-systemes-de-magie","text":"Nous pouvons constater le m\u00eame type de dichotomie avec les syst\u00e8mes de magie. Dans D&D , le magicien lance un certain nombre de sorts par jour, mais il ne lance pas les d\u00e9s pour les lancer : le succ\u00e8s est automatique. Le d\u00e9fenseur fait, lui, un jet de sauvegarde contre le niveau magique du magicien et du sort. C'est encore une m\u00e9canique de seuil \u00e0 simple jet. Dans la plupart des autres jeux, nous avons deux jets : le magicien doit r\u00e9ussir son jet pour r\u00e9ussir son sort, et le d\u00e9fenseur peut faire aussi un jet de sauvegarde. C'est le cas de la plupart de syst\u00e8mes de magie de BRP . Les chances de r\u00e9ussite sont donc tr\u00e8s amoindries, et il reste frustrant pour le joueur d'\u00e9chouer sur un sort basique alors qu'il poss\u00e8de 75% de chances de r\u00e9ussite.

Pour en revenir \u00e0 la CA, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le jeu rend la plupart des monstres \"atteignables\" \u00e0 tous les joueurs de tous les niveaux en raison de leur CA ne d\u00e9passant qu'exceptionnellement 20 (un jet de 20 en attaque a 5% de chances de se produire, cela sans compter les bonus divers), il est donc requis que la chance de toucher un monstre ayant une CA de 20, ne soit pas nulle. Or, si nous voulons atteindre un seuil S avec de multiples D6, comme 3D6 pour atteindre S=18, il est n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer l'effet courbe en cloche des probabilit\u00e9s. Pour avoir 5% de chances d'atteindre ou de d\u00e9passer un seuil S le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 possible avec 3D6, il faut S=16. Avec 2D6, nous n'avons pas cette finesse : moins de 3% de chances de faire 12 et plus de 8% de chances de faire 11 ou plus. Force est de constater qu'introduire de l'al\u00e9a avec les d\u00e9s poly\u00e9driques classiques (D6, D8, D10, D12, D20) dans le but de d\u00e9passer un seuil S avec environ 5% de chances de r\u00e9ussite, la lin\u00e9arit\u00e9 des probabilit\u00e9s du D20 (5% \u00e0 chaque pas) l'assure. Elle permet de garantir que les PJs de bas niveau pourront toucher des CA \u00e9lev\u00e9es et porter des dommages, et donc contribuer \u00e0 un combat contre un adversaire tr\u00e8s puissant, tout comme les PJs de haut niveau. La m\u00e9canique D20 + CA est donc \u00e0 la fois efficace, robuste car fonctionnant avec tous les niveaux, et au final amusante, car elle n'exclue pas les joueurs de faible niveau.","title":"CA et D20"},{"location":"blog/2025/#introduire-la-ca-dans-des-jeux-a-duels","text":"Dans les jeux de la gamme D6 , les choses ne sont pas simples, ne serait-ce que parce la probabilit\u00e9 de faire des grands chiffres est faible (courbe en cloche).

Si l'on veut un jeu amusant dans lequel chaque joueur, quelque soit son niveau, peut avoir une chance de toucher un adversaire, il faut donc que la \"r\u00e9sistance\" totale de cet adversaire soit un seuil fixe atteignable par tous. Si nous mettons ce seuil \u00e0 un pur al\u00e9a, non modifi\u00e9 par des bonus ou des malus, que nous fixons une valeur arbitraire \u00e0 5%, le d20 para\u00eet le meilleur choix (20 est toujours un succ\u00e8s, critique de surcro\u00eet). Les cr\u00e9atures doivent avoir un seuil fixe pour \u00eatre touch\u00e9 et ce seuil repr\u00e9sente une difficult\u00e9 major\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 tous de toucher et de porter des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. Les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts et les points de vie g\u00e9reront le delta de niveau entre les personnages et les monstres.

Il est la compression de deux termes : psi dans le sens de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne psychique, et electronics . Psionics devient un terme d\u00e9crivant la discipline qui \u00e9tudie les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques avec les moyens de l\u2019ing\u00e9nierie moderne de l\u2019\u00e9poque, soit l\u2019\u00e9lectronique. Malgr\u00e9 la promotion de personnes comme John W. Campbell, le terme restera utilis\u00e9 uniquement dans le monde de la science-fiction, avant d\u2019\u00eatre int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans le monde des jeux de r\u00f4les. La version originale de Donjons & Dragons, dite OD&D, est publi\u00e9e en 1974 sous la forme de trois livrets \u00e0 la couverture marron. On trouve dans le premier livret, Men & Magic , un certain nombre de sorts ressemblant \u00e0 des pouvoirs psychiques, et dans le deuxi\u00e8me, Monsters & Treasures , les premi\u00e8res r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 des pouvoirs psychiques, dans la section traitant des \u00e9p\u00e9es magiques. A l\u2019\u00e9poque, le terme psionic n\u2019est pas utilis\u00e9. En 1976, dans le troisi\u00e8me suppl\u00e9ment Eldritch Wizardry cosign\u00e9 par Gary Gygax et Brian Blume, publi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s Greyhawk et Blackmoor , les pouvoirs psychiques arrivent dans le monde des personnages-joueurs et des personnages-non-joueurs. Les r\u00e8gles sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re assez chaotique, ce qui g\u00e9n\u00e9rera vite la r\u00e9putation d\u2019un syst\u00e8me injouable dans le monde des joueurs. Derri\u00e8re la juste critique sur la pr\u00e9sentation, beaucoup de joueurs semblent avoir rejet\u00e9 le suppl\u00e9ment en raison du fait m\u00eame de proposer, en extension \u00e0 un jeu m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique, une gestion des pouvoirs mentaux, habituellement pr\u00e9sents dans les univers de science-fiction.

En effet, le texte original \u00e9tant touffu, nous avons veill\u00e9 \u00e0 traduire le plus fid\u00e8lement possible ses nuances (ce qui donne un style parfois un peu lourd, proche du style original). Dans cette partie, nous avons tent\u00e9 de respecter l\u2019aspect original des r\u00e8gles (polices, alignements, etc.). Cette premi\u00e8re partie a \u00e9t\u00e9, en quelque sorte, \u00ab augment\u00e9e \u00bb : en effet, Eldritch Wizardry \u00e9tant une extension de OD&D, le texte pointe vers les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pr\u00e9sentes dans les livrets pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ; nous avons extrait ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pour en proposer une traduction au sein m\u00eame de ce livre, de sorte que cette compilation devrait se suffire \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame et ne pas n\u00e9cessiter d\u2019ouvrir les ouvrages pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la s\u00e9rie.

Il est la compression de deux termes : psi dans le sens de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne psychique, et electronics . Psionics devient un terme d\u00e9crivant la discipline qui \u00e9tudie les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques avec les moyens de l\u2019ing\u00e9nierie moderne de l\u2019\u00e9poque, soit l\u2019\u00e9lectronique. Malgr\u00e9 la promotion de personnes comme John W. Campbell, le terme restera utilis\u00e9 uniquement dans le monde de la science-fiction, avant d\u2019\u00eatre int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans le monde des jeux de r\u00f4les. La version originale de Donjons & Dragons, dite OD&D, est publi\u00e9e en 1974 sous la forme de trois livrets \u00e0 la couverture marron. On trouve dans le premier livret, Men & Magic , un certain nombre de sorts ressemblant \u00e0 des pouvoirs psychiques, et dans le deuxi\u00e8me, Monsters & Treasures , les premi\u00e8res r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 des pouvoirs psychiques, dans la section traitant des \u00e9p\u00e9es magiques. A l\u2019\u00e9poque, le terme psionic n\u2019est pas utilis\u00e9. En 1976, dans le troisi\u00e8me suppl\u00e9ment Eldritch Wizardry cosign\u00e9 par Gary Gygax et Brian Blume, publi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s Greyhawk et Blackmoor , les pouvoirs psychiques arrivent dans le monde des personnages-joueurs et des personnages-non-joueurs. Les r\u00e8gles sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re assez chaotique, ce qui g\u00e9n\u00e9rera vite la r\u00e9putation d\u2019un syst\u00e8me injouable dans le monde des joueurs. Derri\u00e8re la juste critique sur la pr\u00e9sentation, beaucoup de joueurs semblent avoir rejet\u00e9 le suppl\u00e9ment en raison du fait m\u00eame de proposer, en extension \u00e0 un jeu m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique, une gestion des pouvoirs mentaux, habituellement pr\u00e9sents dans les univers de science-fiction. Nous proposons ici une double pr\u00e9sentation des r\u00e8gles psioniques du suppl\u00e9ment Eldritch Wizardry , suppl\u00e9ment qui contient d\u2019autres choses non traduites en ces pages (notamment le Druide, des monstres, etc.) : La premi\u00e8re partie propose une traduction compl\u00e8te, la plus fid\u00e8le possible, des r\u00e8gles originales relatives aux pouvoirs psioniques. En effet, le texte original \u00e9tant touffu, nous avons veill\u00e9 \u00e0 traduire le plus fid\u00e8lement possible ses nuances (ce qui donne un style parfois un peu lourd, proche du style original). Dans cette partie, nous avons tent\u00e9 de respecter l\u2019aspect original des r\u00e8gles (polices, alignements, etc.). Cette premi\u00e8re partie a \u00e9t\u00e9, en quelque sorte, \u00ab augment\u00e9e \u00bb : en effet, Eldritch Wizardry \u00e9tant une extension de OD&D, le texte pointe vers les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pr\u00e9sentes dans les livrets pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ; nous avons extrait ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pour en proposer une traduction au sein m\u00eame de ce livre, de sorte que cette compilation devrait se suffire \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame et ne pas n\u00e9cessiter d\u2019ouvrir les ouvrages pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la s\u00e9rie. La seconde partie propose une r\u00e9organisation compl\u00e8te de ces r\u00e8gles visant \u00e0 les pr\u00e9senter de mani\u00e8re plus claire et plus logique ; nous esp\u00e9rons que nous aurons \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la hauteur du chantier, plus complexe qu\u2019il n\u2019y paraissait au d\u00e9part. La consultation de certains sites am\u00e9ricains a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour s\u2019assurer de la bonne compr\u00e9hension de certaines r\u00e8gles ambigu\u00ebs qui, encore aujourd\u2019hui, provoquent des commentaires et des incompr\u00e9hensions. Une fois \u00e9clairci, le syst\u00e8me se montre tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, non seulement parce qu\u2019il est tr\u00e8s \u00ab gygaxien \u00bb (on le voit notamment au travers de l\u2019utilisation de r\u00e8gles gigognes), mais aussi parce qu\u2019il est le premier syst\u00e8me complet de pouvoirs psychiques, tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de la magie de OD&D, et qu\u2019il inspirera beaucoup d\u2019autres syst\u00e8mes de pouvoirs bas\u00e9s sur la consommation de points d\u2019\u00e9nergie psionique.

Nous avons la m\u00eame chose dans D&D avec un \u00e9chec de jet contre la Classe d'Armure (CA). Mais quand l'attaque est r\u00e9ussie dans D&D , les dommages sont calcul\u00e9s, ce qui n'est pas le cas dans BRP , en raison du second jet, celui de la d\u00e9fense. Dans BRP , l'adversaire a le choix de parer ou d'esquiver (voir tableau ci-dessus). Si la parade ou l'esquive fonctionne, alors c'est un \u00e9chec pour l'attaquant. J'\u00e9coutais derni\u00e8rement Jason Durall (photo ci-dessus) dire que BRP \u00e9tait un jeu \"transparent\" ( ici ) qui donnait les vraies chances de r\u00e9ussite. C'est vrai pour les comp\u00e9tences, mais pas enti\u00e8rement vrai pour le combat, car un \"succ\u00e8s\" peut devenir facilement un \u00e9chec.

Ce choix de conception n'est pas le m\u00eame que le choix de D&D , jeu dans lequel la CA de l'adversaire est absolue. Certes, le jet de d\u00e9 de l'attaquant a plus ou moins de chances de r\u00e9ussir, mais la CA n'est pas variable en fonction de la puissance de l'attaquant. En quelque sorte, vu du syst\u00e8me D&D , le syst\u00e8me BRP est celui de la double-peine : L'attaquant a un score peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 et donc moins de chances de toucher, dans l'absolu ; Mais en plus, ses chances de toucher sont diminu\u00e9es par la force de l'attaquant. Table 5 : Pourcentage r\u00e9el de r\u00e9ussite dans BRP suivant la force de l'attaquant En fait, le score d'attaque de BRP n'est que la limite th\u00e9orique de la borne sup\u00e9rieure de la probabilit\u00e9 de succ\u00e8s de l'attaquant quand la probabilit\u00e9 de parer/esquiver du d\u00e9fenseur tend vers z\u00e9ro.

Cas des \"special success\" et des critiques # Ce choix est par contre men\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re coh\u00e9rente dans le syst\u00e8me. Par exemple, dans le cas des succ\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciaux et des critiques. Table 6 : Table des succ\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciaux et des critiques Dans BRP , les r\u00e9ussites critiques sont \u00e0 1/20 du score de la comp\u00e9tence, tout comme les \u00e9checs critiques (\u00e0 100% - 1/20 de la comp\u00e9tence). Les succ\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciaux sont \u00e0 1/5 du score de comp\u00e9tence. Ce choix de conception implique que les chances de r\u00e9ussite critique ne sont pas constantes pour tous les PJs mais relatives \u00e0 leur score de comp\u00e9tence. L'approche de D&D est diff\u00e9rente : un 1 est toujours un \u00e9chec critique et un 20 naturel toujours une r\u00e9ussite critique, cela quelque soit les niveaux de comp\u00e9tences. Encore une fois, BRP fait le choix de la relativit\u00e9. Notons que la difficult\u00e9 et la facilit\u00e9, dans BRP v5, sont trait\u00e9es avec des bonus ou des malus de type : +50%/+20%/+0%/-20%/-50% qui sont, eux, des bonus et malus absolus.

Car fondamentalement, pour ne pas y aller par quatre chemins, c'est la (seule) r\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui vaille en cas de litige. En effet, la loi ne reconna\u00eet ni les licences Creative Common , ni les licences OGL V1.0a, ni les licences ORC. Alors pourquoi tant de bruit autour de ces licences ? Nous allons tenter de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question. Avertissement : cet article n'est pas un conseil en droit am\u00e9ricain, aussi ne le prenez pas pour argent comptant dans le cadre d'un proc\u00e8s. Pour autant, les arguments qu'il recense sont parfaitement align\u00e9s avec la loi am\u00e9ricaine sur le copyright. Aussi, en cas de litige, n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 demander \u00e0 des avocats sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s de faire le travail afin d'arriver aux m\u00eames conclusions que celles de cet article. Le droit am\u00e9ricain sur le copyright # La loi am\u00e9ricaine sur le copyright est un document d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 Title 17 , disponible en ligne et assorti d'une jurisprudence assez importante. Voici le lien vers le Title 17 ainsi que vers le PDF du Compendium of US Copyright Office Practices et vers le glossaire . Ces PDFs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sauvegard\u00e9s \u00e0 la date de l'article. Attention : ces documents vivent et peuvent changer. N'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 consulter le site copyright.gov . Quelques d\u00e9finitions # Le paragraphe 101 du Title 17 des d\u00e9finitions d\u00e9finit (entre autres) les notions suivantes. \u201cCopyright owner\u201d, with respect to any one of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, refers to the owner of that particular right. Dans la loi am\u00e9ricaine, un copyright est un ensemble de droits sur une \u0153uvre, cela depuis 1978. Chaque droit peut faire l'objet de transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou d'une licence exclusive ou non-exclusive : La licence exclusive s'apparente \u00e0 un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur un ou plusieurs droits (mais pas tous) ; La licence non-exclusive s'apparente \u00e0 une autorisation d'usage sous certaines conditions et pour une certaine dur\u00e9e. A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d. La notion d'\"\u0153uvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e\" est bien entendu au c\u0153ur de la notion de jeux fond\u00e9s sur des SRD et sur les licences qui les accompagnent. \u201cLiterary works\u201d are works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied. Bien entendu les JDR sont des \u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires, mais un peu particuli\u00e8res, comme nous allons le voir en raison des diff\u00e9rents types de contenus qui les composent. Nous trouvons aussi la d\u00e9finition d'une licence dans le Compendium et le Glossaire : License: An agreement by which a party grants another party one or more rights (but fewer than all rights), usually limited to a particular territory and/or time period. A license may be granted as an exclusive license or a nonexclusive license. Dans le cadre des trois mod\u00e8les de licences que nous allons \u00e9tudier (copyright, OGL et ORC), nous parlons de licences non-exclusives. On trouve la d\u00e9finition d'une licence non-exclusive dans le glossaire. Nonexclusive license: A nonexclusive license is \u201ca license of intellectual property rights that gives the licensee a right to use, make, or sell the licensed item on a shared basis with the licensor and possibly other licensees.\u201d BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1 004 (9th ed. 2009). Traduction : une licence non-exclusive est \"une licence de droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle qui donne au r\u00e9cipiendaire le droit d'usage, de cr\u00e9er ou de vendre l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment sous licence sur une base partag\u00e9e avec le propri\u00e9taire des droits et possiblement d'autres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la licence\". Cette d\u00e9finition ne s'applique pas totalement \u00e0 notre cas dans la mesure o\u00f9 les licences dont nous parlons permettent de ne pas payer de royalties au propri\u00e9taire du contenu. Pour autant, dans la suite du document, nous parlerons uniquement de licences non-exclusives. D\u00e9finition du copyright (paragraphe 102) # \u00a7 102 \u00b7 Subject matter of copyright: In general (a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. Works of authorship include the following categories: (1) literary works; Les JDR entrent dans la cat\u00e9gorie des \u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires. (2) musical works, including any accompanying words; (3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music; (4) pantomimes and choreographic works; (5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; (6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works; (7) sound recordings; and (8) architectural works. (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work. Le paragraphe 102.b. est fondamental. Il indique que les r\u00e8gles du jeu (process, proc\u00e9dure, syst\u00e8me op\u00e9ratoire, etc.) ne sont pas soumises au copyright . Il en va de m\u00eame de la loi am\u00e9ricaine sur les brevets ( patents ). Les r\u00e8gles du jeu dont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par la jurisprudence comme des id\u00e9es abstraites ( abstract ideas ), et donc ne sont pas \"patentables\". Cette id\u00e9e est \u00e0 la base de la licence OGL et de la licence ORC, comme nous le verrons. Compilations et \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es (paragraphe 103) # \u00a7 103 \u00b7 Subject matter of copyright: Compilations and derivative works (a) The subject matter of copyright as specified by section 102 includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully. (b) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work , as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the preexisting material. Le paragraphe 103.b. est tr\u00e8s clair : le copyright original s'applique encore dans l'\u0153uvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e, et le copyright de l'auteur de l'\u0153uvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e ne poss\u00e8de un copyright que sur la partie qu'il a modifi\u00e9e ou cr\u00e9\u00e9e (voir sch\u00e9ma plus loin dans l'article). Les droits exclusifs inclus dans le copyright (paragraphe 106) # \u00a7 106 \u00b7 Exclusive rights in copyrighted works 39 Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; Le droit de cr\u00e9er des \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es est un droit du possesseur du copyright. (3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; Le possesseur du copyright a le droit de vendre des copies ou de passer par un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, une location, un leasing ou un pr\u00eat. Ce cas existe dans le JDR pour les jeux exploitant les licences officielles des films, des s\u00e9ries ou des \u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires. (4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly; (5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and (6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission. Conclusion temporaire # Nous avons d\u00e9sormais une connaissance des sujets suivants : Ce qu'est un copyright et quels sont les droits qui lui sont associ\u00e9s ; Une licence non-exclusive est un droit d'usage de ces droits avec des conditions, Dans le cadre d'une \u0153uvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e, le copyright original s'applique toujours sur le contenu original ; se pose donc la question de la licence du contenu original quelque soit le nombre d'interm\u00e9diaires (voir figure 1 ci-dessous). Synth\u00e8se de la probl\u00e9matique dans le JDR # La probl\u00e9matique des droits dans le JDR se pose \u00e0 deux niveaux : Comment un acteur A permet \u00e0 un acteur B d'utiliser son contenu dans des produits d\u00e9riv\u00e9s ? Comment l'acteur B permet \u00e0 un acteur C d'utiliser le contenu d\u00e9riv\u00e9 pour d'autres produits d\u00e9riv\u00e9s ? Vision synth\u00e9tique, cas des licences non-exclusives # La figure suivante montre comment la loi am\u00e9ricaine sur le copyright r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette question. (N'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 ouvrir l'image dans un nouvel onglet pour une meilleure d\u00e9finition.) Nous voyons sur ce sch\u00e9ma les deux niveaux de gestion des droits sur le contenu. Pour faire plus simple, nous utiliserons le mot \"extension\" pour qualifier tout ce qui peut \u00eatre copie compl\u00e8te ou partielle et modification de tout genre. Pour ce qui est des r\u00e8gles, quelques que soient leurs extensions, ces derni\u00e8res ne sont pas soumises au copyright. Elles peuvent donc \u00eatres \u00e9tendues. Cela est vrai \u00e0 tous les niveaux. Constatons qu'au niveau de C, nous avons potentiellement quatre types de r\u00e8gles (en bleu), toutes non soumises au copyright (dans le cas o\u00f9 C est dans une g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie de contenus allant de A vers B vers C). Cela veut aussi dire qu' il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'attribuer la paternit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles \u00e0 qui que ce soit \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elles n'appartiennent \u00e0 personne . Ce point est tr\u00e8s important, comme nous le verrons ensuite. Pour ce qui est du contenu sous copyright cr\u00e9\u00e9 par A, ce dernier ne peut pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 sans une licence explicite de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 entre A et B. Cette licence ne peut pas \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9rique, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle doit pr\u00e9ciser les termes de l'usage. Par exemple, si je veux publier un sc\u00e9nario pour Forgotten Realms , il me faut faire un accord explicite avec WotC, une licence non-exclusive, dans l'esprit de la d\u00e9finition de la licence de la loi sur le copyright : [...] a right to use, make, or sell the licensed item on a shared basis with the licensor [...] Evidemment, les sujets des royalties, du respect de l'esprit de l'\u0153uvre originale et potentiellement de la qualit\u00e9 de l'\u0153uvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e seront au c\u0153ur des n\u00e9gociations. Cela vaut pour toutes les situations de ce type et le sch\u00e9ma montre une licence explicite entre B et C sur une extension par C du contenu sp\u00e9cifique cr\u00e9\u00e9 par B et pour lequel B poss\u00e8de le copyright. Le seul cas non trivial de cette situation est le cas en rouge sur le diagramme. Supposons que B ait une licence avec A pour faire une extension de son contenu sous copyright. C peut \u00e9tendre \u00e0 nouveau ce contenu s'il poss\u00e8de deux licences : Une de la part de A sur l'extension du contenu original cr\u00e9\u00e9 par A, Une de la part de B sur l'extension de la contribution de B. Car, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le contenu sous copyright est et reste, dans le cadre des licences non-exclusives, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du possesseur du copyright original. Cas des licences exclusives # La licence exclusive proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un ou plusieurs droits (mais pas de tous), pour une dur\u00e9e et des conditions donn\u00e9es. Si je poss\u00e8de un personnage de BD par exemple, je peux transf\u00e9rer le droit d'adaptation \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cin\u00e9matographique de mani\u00e8re exclusive, moyennant accord financier, conditions et dur\u00e9e. Dans le monde du JDR, la licence exclusive est utilis\u00e9e pour faire d'un JDR le JDR officiel d'une marque, d'un film, d'une s\u00e9rie ou d'une \u0153uvre litt\u00e9raire. Par exemple, les h\u00e9ritiers de Tolkien ont accord\u00e9 \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de JDR aucours du temps le droit exclusif de faire un JDR dans le monde de Tolkien : ICE pour Middle-Earth Role Playing (1984-1999), Decipher pour The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game (2002-2007), Cubicle7 pour The One Ring 1e (2011-2019) et Adventures in Middle-Earth pour D&D 5e, Free League Publishing pour The One Ring 2e et The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying pour D&D 5e (depuis 2002). Ces licences sont exclusives (c'est un transfert exclusif du droit de cr\u00e9er un JDR dans l'univers de Tolkien), elles ont une dur\u00e9e de vie, des conditions et un arrangement financier. Cette situation semble, dans le monde du JDR, limit\u00e9e aux adaptations d'\u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires, cin\u00e9matographiques ou t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelles comme Star Gate RPG, Dune RPG, Indiana Jones RPG, Men in Black RPG, Star Wars RPG, etc. Seconde conclusion sur la loi sur le copyright # Selon la loi sur le copyright, il est donc parfaitement possible d'utiliser les r\u00e8gles de n'importe quel jeu : Sans licence, Sans cr\u00e9diter l'auteur original, Pour faire des \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es commerciales. Certes, il faudra faire attention \u00e0 la proclamation de la compatibilit\u00e9 avec les r\u00e8gles de l'oeuvre originale : pas d'utilisation des trademarks, ni du copyright du d\u00e9tenteur original. Une formule comme \" le plus grand JDR du monde \" semble accept\u00e9e par le march\u00e9. Certes l'incertitude porte alors que la d\u00e9finition de la fronti\u00e8re entre r\u00e8gle et contenu sous copyright. Dans la premi\u00e8re version du SRD de Basic Roleplaying Game 4e ( BRP ), Chaosium pr\u00e9vient que certaines m\u00e9caniques de jeu, dont des concepts de magie, sont sous copyright. Ces m\u00e9caniques de jeu sont, en effet, tr\u00e8s li\u00e9es avec le background du jeu. Il est possible, en effet, de consid\u00e9rer que les r\u00e8gles concernant la \"sant\u00e9 mentale\" dans Call of Cthulhu sont soumises au copyright parce qu'elles sont une m\u00e9canique sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 l'univers et int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans cet univers comme partie constitutive de ce dernier. Pour le SRD 5.1 de D&D , les choses sont plus simples : en enlevant quelques noms propres, les sorts deviennent de pures m\u00e9caniques non li\u00e9es \u00e0 des univers et sortent donc du domaine du copyright. La preuve en est que les m\u00e9caniques psioniques de Dark Sun ne font pas partie du SRD, alors que ce sont des r\u00e8gles, mais faisant partie int\u00e9grante de l'univers Dark Sun soumis au copyright. Notons quand m\u00eame, dans le SRD 5.1 de D&D , une partie introductive d\u00e9crivant explicitement ce qui est Product Identity (les trademarks, les noms propres et quelques contenus sp\u00e9cifiques). Encore une fois, dans le monde du JDR, le SRD sert \u00e0 tracer une limite entre contenu non soumis au copyright et contenu prot\u00e9g\u00e9. La licence OGL V1.0a # En 2000, WotC publie l'\u00e9trange licence OGL. Cette derni\u00e8re est vue comme une avanc\u00e9e majeure, sans doute parce que personne ou presque, dans le monde du JDR, ne comprend le droit am\u00e9ricain du copyright. En effet, si les gens comprenaient le sujet, personne n'aurait int\u00e9gr\u00e9 cette licence dans les produits d\u00e9riv\u00e9s. Les effets positifs de cette licence sont de lib\u00e9rer une certaine cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 dans les \u0153uvres OGL et de cr\u00e9er notamment le mouvement OSR (Old School Renaissance) qui revient aux bases du JDR et aux premi\u00e8res versions de D&D . Les effets n\u00e9gatifs sont que la communaut\u00e9 du JDR se met en position de suiveuse de WotC, et ne parvient pas \u00e0 comprendre que la licence OGL demande plus que la loi am\u00e9ricaine et qu'en cela, elle est inutile. Examen de la licence # Nous allons analyser cette licence au regard du droit am\u00e9ricain sur le copyright. OPEN GAME LICENSE Version 1.0a The following text is the property of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. and is Copyright 2000 Wizards of the Coast, Inc (\"Wizards\"). All Rights Reserved. Ce point a \u00e9t\u00e9 vu comme un probl\u00e8me. Or le fait que le texte de la licence appartienne au possesseur du copyright est normal. Le possesseur de la licence peut dicter ses lois sur le contenu qu'il partage - mais il doit respecter aussi la loi sur le copyright. \u00a71. Definitions: (a)\"Contributors\" means the copyright and/or trademark owners who have contributed Open Game Content; Cette premi\u00e8re d\u00e9finition est vague. Dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus, A, B et C sont des contributeurs. (b)\"Derivative Material\" means copyrighted material including derivative works and translations (including into other computer languages), potation, modification, correction, addition, extension, upgrade, improvement, compilation, abridgment or other form in which an existing work may be recast, transformed or adapted; Cette notion de Derivative Material est presque mot pour mot la d\u00e9finition de Derivative Work pr\u00e9sent dans la loi US sur le copyright. (c) \"Distribute\" means to reproduce, license, rent, lease, sell, broadcast, publicly display, transmit or otherwise distribute; L\u00e0 encore, la licence reprend les d\u00e9finitions du droit am\u00e9ricain sur le copyright. (d)\"Open Game Content\" means the game mechanic and includes the methods, procedures, processes and routines WotC reprend le paragraphe 102.b. de la loi US. C'est la premi\u00e8re partie du contenu du document soumis \u00e0 cette licence. to the extent such content does not embody the Product Identity Le Product Identity est, selon WotC, la partie soumise au copyright. C'est la deuxi\u00e8me partie du contenu du texte dont il question. and is an enhancement over the prior art Cette phase est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9trange et cela sur deux points. Tout d'abord, WotC semble vouloir dire que de nouvelles r\u00e8gles port\u00e9es par la personne exer\u00e7ant la licence doit \u00eatre une am\u00e9lioration de ce qui existe. C'est un v\u0153u pieu, mais tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 prouver. Par exemple, le Black Hack est-il une am\u00e9lioration des r\u00e8gles ou une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration ? Le second point est que cela n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec le fait d'\u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d' Open Game Content (OGC) . Par rapport \u00e0 la loi, toute r\u00e8gle de jeu est OGC, qu'elle soit une am\u00e9lioration ou pas. and any additional content clearly identified as Open Game Content by the Contributor, Il s'agit l\u00e0 de la troisi\u00e8me partie du contenu : un contenu soumis au copyright mais que le titulaire de la licence aurait envie de d\u00e9clarer OGC. Notons que nous entrons ici un peu dans la confusion. Nous parlions jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, WotC, qui d\u00e9finissait une licence pour que des personnes ou des compagnies aient l'usage de son contenu (A dans le sch\u00e9mas ci-dessus). Nous sommes maintenant \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 nous parlons des d\u00e9clarations des possesseurs de licences (B dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus). C'est le probl\u00e8me de vouloir faire une licence g\u00e9n\u00e9rique. Au titre de la loi am\u00e9ricaine, le contenu soumis au copyright reste soumis au copyright. Comme ce contenu a une certaine valeur, son possesseur devrait d\u00e9finir la licence avec ceux qui en auront l'usage. Cette licence doit avoir une dur\u00e9e, des conditions et un arrangement financier. Bien entendu, rien n'oblige le possesseur de ce copyright \u00e0 utiliser la licence OGL pour licencier son contenu. and means any work covered by this License, including translations and derivative works under copyright law, but specifically excludes Product Identity. Cette phrase est tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange. De fait, les \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es selon la loi du copyright ne sont pas OGC (les traductions ne sont pas OGC de l'avis m\u00eame de la licence OGL, voir ci-dessus). Il est possible que WotC ait voulu parler des traductions et des autres \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es soumises au copyright que les auteurs auraient voulu mettre en OGC quand m\u00eame (alors qu'elles ne le sont pas par d\u00e9faut). Mais la formulation est totalement obscure si c'est cette interpr\u00e9tation qu'il faut retenir. Mais voyons donc la fameuse notion de Product Identity . (e) \"Product Identity\" means product and product line names, logos and identifying marks including trade dress; Nous parlons ici de trademarks . artifacts; creatures characters; stories, storylines, plots, thematic elements, dialogue, incidents, language, artwork, symbols, designs, depictions, likenesses, formats, poses, concepts, themes and graphic, photographic and other visual or audio representations; names and descriptions of characters, spells, enchantments, Malheureusement, les sorts sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des r\u00e8gles du jeu. Le cas des sorts associ\u00e9s \u00e0 des noms propres est plus ambigu, car nous sommes entre le Product Identity et l'OGC, donc d\u00e9fendable en tant que Product Identity dans la mesure o\u00f9 la r\u00e8gle est partie int\u00e9grante de l'univers (cf. remarques ci-dessus \u00e0 propos de Dark Sun ). personalities, teams, personas, likenesses and special abilities; places, locations, environments, creatures, equipment, magical or supernatural abilities or effects, logos, symbols, or graphic designs; Cette liste est assez \u00e9trange car contraire avec le contenu ouvert par WotC dans le SRD 5.1 de D&D . En ouvrant les sorts dans le SRD 5.1, WotC est en contradiction avec la licence appos\u00e9e sur le SRD ! On verra plus loin, avec l'affaire du SRD V2.0, qu'en plus de 20 ans, la compr\u00e9hension du droit du copyright semble toujours obscure chez certaines personnes de WotC. and any other trademark or registered trademark clearly identified as Product identity by the owner of the Product Identity, and which specifically excludes the Open Game Content; Encore les trademarks. (f) \"Trademark\" means the logos, names, mark, sign, motto, designs that are used by a Contributor to identify itself or its products or the associated products contributed to the Open Game License by the Contributor De nouveau les trademarks. (g) \"Use\", \"Used\" or \"Using\" means to use, Distribute, copy, edit, format, modify, translate and otherwise create Derivative Material of Open Game Content. M\u00eame d\u00e9finition que Derivative Work de la loi US. (h) \"You\" or \"Your\" means the licensee in terms of this agreement. \u00a72. The License: This License applies to any Open Game Content that contains a notice indicating that the Open Game Content may only be Used under and in terms of this License. You must affix such a notice to any Open Game Content that you Use. No terms may be added to or subtracted from this License except as described by the License itself. No other terms or conditions may be applied to any Open Game Content distributed using this License. \u00a73. Offer and Acceptance: By Using the Open Game Content You indicate Your acceptance of the terms of this License. \u00a74. Grant and Consideration: In consideration for agreeing to use this License, the Contributors grant You a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license with the exact terms of this License to Use, the Open Game Content. Droit d'usage du contenu OGC. La formulation employ\u00e9e, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license , est \u00e9trangement emprunt\u00e9e au cas de l'administration am\u00e9ricaine d\u00e9crit dans le cadre de la loi US sur le copyright. En effet, dans le paragraphe 105 de ladite loi, il est stipul\u00e9 qu'un employ\u00e9 de l'Etat appartenant \u00e0 certaines organisations conserve son copyright mais qu'on peut lui ordonner de donner \u00e0 l'Etat une irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, nonexclusive license to reproduce, distribute, perform, or display . Le probl\u00e8me est que WotC n'est pas l'Etat, que la licence est un contrat entre deux parties et que si une des deux parties meurt ou le souhaite, la licence s'arr\u00eate, ce qui n'est pas le cas de l'Etat am\u00e9ricain. \u00a75.Representation of Authority to Contribute: If You are contributing original material as Open Game Content, You represent that Your Contributions are Your original creation and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. Encore une formulation absconse : que doit-on entendre par \"mat\u00e9riau original\" ( original material ) ? Si ce mat\u00e9riau est compos\u00e9 de r\u00e8gles, alors aucun copyright ne peut \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9 ; sinon, ce mat\u00e9riau est sous copyright. Dans le premier cas, il n'y a pas besoin de repr\u00e9sentation ; dans le second, le possesseur du copyright devrait poser une notice copyright comme demand\u00e9 par le droit am\u00e9ricain. De plus, rien n'indique que le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence OGL voudra utiliser la m\u00eame licence quand il voudra licencier son travail d\u00e9riv\u00e9, celui sur lequel il poss\u00e8de le copyright. Notons qu'il est dangereux de pr\u00e9sumer que l'on donne gratuitement un copyright sans licence, car utiliser la licence OGL sur un contenu copyright\u00e9 que l'on poss\u00e8de et que l'on souhaite ouvrir est tr\u00e8s dangereux pour le possesseur - et le droit am\u00e9ricain nous le dit. Supposons que je cr\u00e9e dans le cadre d'une licence OGL D&D Mister DarkFuzz, un h\u00e9ros aux caract\u00e9ristiques sp\u00e9ciales et que je l'int\u00e8gre dans ma d\u00e9claration OCG en tant que copyright que je transforme en OGC. Supposons que quelqu'un produise une campagne \u00e0 succ\u00e8s, des livres et un film sur Mister DarkFuzz. Quels sont mes moyens de contr\u00f4ler mon copyright ? \u00a76.Notice of License Copyright: You must update the COPYRIGHT NOTICE portion of this License to include the exact text of the COPYRIGHT NOTICE of any Open Game Content You are copying, modifying or distributing, and You must add the title, the copyright date, and the copyright holder's name to the COPYRIGHT NOTICE of any original Open Game Content you Distribute. Evidemment, r\u00e9utiliser du contenu non soumis \u00e0 copyright (OGC) ne n\u00e9cessite pas de cr\u00e9diter ni WotC, ni Gygax, ni qui que ce soit. Car, les r\u00e8gles de D&D , dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles sont g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, ne peuvent pas porter de copyright. On dirait que cet article est l\u00e0 pour dire \u00e0 Hasbro, la maison m\u00e8re de WotC : regardez, vous avez achet\u00e9 de l'IP ( Intellectual Property ) ! Mais le fait est que non. Au regard du droit US sur le copyright, tout le SRD \u00e9tait ouvert avant m\u00eame qu'il ne soit publi\u00e9. Il n'est donc pas besoin de cr\u00e9diter quelqu'un pour un mat\u00e9riau qui est dans le domaine public. J'entends des m\u00e2choires qui grincent, mais c'est bien la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. \u00a77. Use of Product Identity: You agree not to Use any Product Identity, including as an indication as to compatibility, except as expressly licensed in another, independent Agreement with the owner of each element of that Product Identity. WotC rejoint le droit am\u00e9ricain (voir les licences explicites dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus). On ne peut pas licencier du contenu sous copyright sans quelques pr\u00e9cautions. You agree not to indicate compatibility or co-adaptability with any Trademark or Registered Trademark in conjunction with a work containing Open Game Content except as expressly licensed in another, independent Agreement with the owner of such Trademark or Registered Trademark. La cons\u00e9quence de cette phrase est de statuer la compatibilit\u00e9 avec D&D par une phrase du genre \"compatible avec le plus grand JDR du monde\". The use of any Product Identity in Open Game Content does not constitute a challenge to the ownership of that Product Identity. The owner of any Product Identity used in Open Game Content shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to that Product Identity. Amusant : cette remarque est totalement conforme avec le droit am\u00e9ricain. Tout possesseur de copyright garde ses droits m\u00eame s'il a permis \u00e0 des tiers d'utiliser un ou plusieurs droits non exclusifs de mani\u00e8re non payante. Ainsi, oui, WotC a raison, accorder l'usage gratuit d'un contenu sous copyright d\u00e9clar\u00e9 comme OGC ne remet pas en cause la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du copyright, et n'est pas un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (cas des licences non-exclusives). \u00a78. Identification: If you distribute Open Game Content You must clearly indicate which portions of the work that you are distributing are Open Game Content. Voil\u00e0 quelque chose de contraignant et j'avoue ne l'avoir jamais vraiment vu faire. Les gens pr\u00e9cisent, au contraire, ce qui est Product Identity. Les reste est OGC. \u00a79. Updating the License: Wizards or its designated Agents may publish updated versions of this License. You may use any authorized version of this License to copy, modify and distribute any Open Game Content originally distributed under any version of this License. Soit en bon fran\u00e7ais : \u00a79. Mise \u00e0 jour de la licence : Wizards ou ses repr\u00e9sentants d\u00e9sign\u00e9s peuvent publier des mises \u00e0 jour de cette licence. Vous pouvez utiliser n'importe quelle version autoris\u00e9e de cette licence pour copier, modifier et distribuer n'importe quel contenu Open Game Content originellement distribu\u00e9 sous n'importe quelle version de cette licence. Cet article indique que WotC peut d\u00e9cider que la version V1.0a est non autoris\u00e9e et autoriser une V2 qui elle demande 50% des revenus faits par le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence. C'est en un sens ce qu'ils ont fait avec la tentative de licence V2.0. Beaucoup de gens ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cet article comme un risque juridique important. Au final, ce n'en est pas un du tout en raison du type de contenus publi\u00e9 par WotC (voir plus bas). \u00a710. Copy of this License: You MUST include a copy of this License with every copy of the Open Game Content You Distribute. Nous remettons en cause ce besoin au regard de la loi sur le copyright (voir plus loin) en raison du type de contenu distribu\u00e9 par WotC \u00e0 l'origine : si le premier contenu n'a pas de copyright, il n'est pas besoin de cascader la licence. \u00a711. Use of Contributor Credits: You may not market or advertise the Open Game Content using the name of any Contributor unless You have written permission from the Contributor to do so. Encore une fois le sujet des trademarks. Oui, personne ne doit user des trademarks de WotC sans accord. Mais c'est vrai de toutes les trademarks. \u00a712. Inability to Comply: If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Open Game Content due to statute, judicial order, or governmental regulation then You may not Use any Open Game Material so affected. \u00a713. Termination: This License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with all terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses shall survive the termination of this License. La derni\u00e8re affirmation est p\u00e9remptoire mais rien ne le prouve. Si WotC dispara\u00eet et se fait racheter par une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la licence peut \u00eatre termin\u00e9e. Mais, au final, est-ce si grave ? Non (voir ci-dessous). \u00a714. Reformation: If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. \u00a715.

END OF LICENSE Une pierre, deux coups et beaucoup de confusion # La licence OGL V1.0a (OGL) tente de r\u00e9soudre deux probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 la fois : Cr\u00e9er une licence g\u00e9n\u00e9rique entre WotC et ses r\u00e9cipiendaires ; Cr\u00e9er une licence applicable entre ses r\u00e9cipiendaires et les gens \u00e0 qui ils voudraient accorder le m\u00eame droit. La licence OGL est donc \"double\". Elle est aussi contaminante \"implicitement\". Les trois types de contenu d'un document, selon WotC, sont : l'OGC : des r\u00e8gles soumises \u00e0 la licence OGL ; le Product Identity : exclus de la licence et copyright r\u00e9serv\u00e9 de celui qui utilise la licence ; le Product Identity d\u00e9clar\u00e9 OGL par le possesseur du copyright. Or selon la loi sur le copyright et selon la d\u00e9finition m\u00eame de WotC, le contenu OGC est non soumis au copyright . Donc pas besoin de licence pour l'exploiter. Et pas besoin non plus de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 son auteur. Donc pas besoin de licence OGL . Selon la loi sur le copyright, ce que WotC d\u00e9finit comme Product Identity (en excluant monstres g\u00e9n\u00e9riques et sorts g\u00e9n\u00e9riques) est soumis \u00e0 la loi sur le copyright, tout comme les trademarks. Il n'est donc pas possible de les utiliser sans accord explicite et gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 avec WotC. La licence OGL n'apporte rien non plus sur cette cat\u00e9gorie de contenu qui est, de facto , prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le droit am\u00e9ricain. Evidemment, la licence OGL peut jouer le r\u00f4le de \"rappel de la loi\" aupr\u00e8s de ceux qui, ne comprenant pas bien les limites des contenus prot\u00e9g\u00e9s et non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, auraient envie d'utiliser le contenu des univers D&D ou les marques pour leur produit d\u00e9riv\u00e9. Elle marque en quelque sorte la limite explicite entre les types de contenus. Il reste la troisi\u00e8me sorte de contenu : le Product Identity d\u00e9clar\u00e9 OGL par le possesseur du copyright dans le but de le transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 des r\u00e9cipiendaires au travers d'une licence (laquelle ?). La loi am\u00e9ricaine est simple sur le sujet : le copyright reste \u00e0 son ayant droit et la licence doit \u00eatre d\u00e9finie (exclusive avec transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ou non-exclusive). Celui qui veut licencier son propre contenu (par exemple B \u00e0 C dans le diagramme ci-dessus) choisira alors son mode licensing, ses conditions et sa dur\u00e9e. Intention et r\u00e9alit\u00e9 # L'ironie de l'affaire est que WotC, dans son SRD 3.5, ne publie en 2000 que du contenu OGC. Donc ils ne font que publier ce qui, chez eux, n'est pas soumis au copyright ! Et donc que tout le monde a le droit de le copier sans autre forme de proc\u00e8s ! Ils n'ont pas besoin de licence pour \u00e7a, mais cette derni\u00e8re va faire peur... et va, en m\u00eame temps, dynamiser le march\u00e9. A l'examen, il semble donc bien que cette licence OGL soit une grosse arnaque . Beaucoup de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s vont s'encha\u00eener \u00e0 l'OGL alors que ne pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rencer l'OGL et prendre le contenu du SRD sans cr\u00e9diter WotC est parfaitement l\u00e9gal, selon les propres termes de la licence elle-m\u00eame, et surtout selon la d\u00e9finition du copyright US. Je pense qu'\u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 90, apr\u00e8s le rachat de TSR, WotC a compris que les r\u00e8gles n'\u00e9taient ni copyright-ables, ni patent-ables. Ils se sont dit qu'il ne fallait pas que le monde du JDR s'en aper\u00e7oive. Ils ont trouv\u00e9 ce coup de pub \u00e9norme, inspir\u00e9 du software open source, coup de pub qui est, de fait, une gigantesque arnaque. Et tout le monde est tomb\u00e9 dans le panneau ! Et moi le premier en d\u00e9couvrant toute l'histoire vingt ans apr\u00e8s la bataille. Mais apr\u00e8s analyse, ce coup de bluff est un baudruche. Et comme le milieu du JDR est un petit monde avec peu de juristes, la pilule est pass\u00e9e, notamment celle de contaminer les contenus \"descendants\", soit entre le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la \"licence\" de WotC et le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence du r\u00e9cipiendaire de la \"licence\" de WotC (entre B et C). Car si le contenu de WotC OGC est compos\u00e9 de r\u00e8gles sur lesquelles aucun copyright n'est possible, il n'existe aucun devoir \u00e0 une personne physique ou morale qui voudrait utiliser les r\u00e8gles de D&D pour \u00e9tendre ces r\u00e8gles, ainsi qu'aucune obligation d'attribution. Au travers de cette licence, WotC a, de plus, menac\u00e9 toute la communaut\u00e9 : En r\u00e9affirmant qu'on ne pouvait pas pirater impun\u00e9ment ses marques et ses univers (le fameux Product Identity), ce qui est totalement vrai et compatible avec le droit am\u00e9ricain sur le copyright ; En levant toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 et en publiant le contenu OGC ouvert, fa\u00e7on de tracer la limite entre leur Product Identity et ce sur quoi aucun copyright ne portait. C'est malin, quoique la licence soit mal \u00e9crite, bien plus mal que le droit US lui-m\u00eame. Utilisation de la licence CC-BY-4.0 pour le SRD 5.1 de D&D : arnaque phase 2 ? # La licence Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 est une licence non-exclusive qui n'\u00e9tablit aucun transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les licences Creative Common ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es dans le but d'\u00eatre une alternative aux licences GNU, GNU GPL notamment, licences ayant des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s contaminantes : quand un composant logiciel est GPL 3.0 et qu'il est utilis\u00e9 et distribu\u00e9 dans un software, ce dernier devient GPL 3.0 et donc invendable et open source ( free software ). D'ailleurs, il serait sans doute bien de regarder de plus pr\u00e8s les licences GNU et leur conformit\u00e9 au droit US. Analyse de la licence CC4 dans le cadre du SRD du D&D # La licence CC4 porte la m\u00eame dualit\u00e9 que la licence OGL : selon les moments elle parle de celui qui poss\u00e8de le copyright et qui autorise l'usage de son contenu sans royalties (A dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus) ; \u00e0 d'autres moments, elle parle de celui qui exploite le contenu et qui a envie de l'utilisation de son contenu dans la cha\u00eene \"descendante\" des acteurs (B et C dans le sch\u00e9ma). Dans la page de garde de la licence , on nous explique : You are free to: Share \u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially . Adapt \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially . The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms. Le dernier point me semble trop simpliste car, comme la licence est bas\u00e9e sur le copyright, si le \"licensor\" change, alors le copyright change et donc les droits d'exploitation peuvent \u00eatre remis en question. Regardons ce qui est \u00e9crit dans la licence . Notre analyse portera uniquement sur l'application de cette licence au monde des JDR (et plus particuli\u00e8rement au SRD). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions [...] L'aspect contractuel de la licence est expliqu\u00e9 en pr\u00e9ambule. Dans les d\u00e9finitions, on voit de suite que la licence CC-BY-4.0 (CC4 pour faire plus court) n'est pas pens\u00e9e pour le sujet du jeu de r\u00f4le, soit pour une \u0153uvre \u00e9tant un m\u00e9lange de contenus \"litt\u00e9raires\" dont (au regard de la loi am\u00e9ricaine) une partie poss\u00e8de des droits et est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le copyright (les personnages nomm\u00e9s, les histoires, les lieux, etc.) et une partie ne l'est pas (les r\u00e8gles du jeu). La licence CC4 ne propose que deux concepts concernant les contenus : Licensed Material : le contenu qui est ouvert, sur lequel celui qui poss\u00e8de les droits les partage \u00e0 l'autres ; Adapted Material : ce que les autres font avec ce contenu. La licence repousse le probl\u00e8me des deux types de contenus du Adapted Material , ceux sous copyright et ceux sans, \u00e0 la licence que va employer l'utilisateur des contenus sous CC4. 1.b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. Comme dans le droit am\u00e9ricain, celui qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un contenu d\u00e9riv\u00e9 poss\u00e8de un copyright sur ses contributions seulement (pas sur le contenu original bien s\u00fbr). 2.a.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Cet article montre les droits donn\u00e9s par cette licence. Il est possible de faire ce que l'on souhaite avec le contenu original dans le monde entier et sans payer de royalties si tant est que l'on respecte les conditions d' attribution de la licence, soit que l'on nomme le cr\u00e9ateur original. 2.a.5. paragraph 2. No downstream restrictions . You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. En effet, au regard du droit US sur le copyright, il n'est pas possible d'imposer des contraintes diff\u00e9rentes ou suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la licence du contenu original ( Licensed Material ). La question est : est-ce que ce contenu est CC4 et donc doit rester CC4 dans toutes les it\u00e9rations, notamment dans les liens entre un B et un C au titre du sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus. 2.b.3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. \"To the extend possible\" veut dire \"dans la mesure du possible\", ce qui n'est pas tr\u00e8s rassurant. Mais la deuxi\u00e8me partie de l'article pr\u00e9cise que les r\u00e9serves concernant le fait que celui qui ouvre son contenu veuille des royalties doivent \u00eatre explicites. J'avoue que cet article me laisse un peu perplexe. Si quelqu'un peut prouver devant un tribunal que, parce que sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait menac\u00e9e de faillite, alors il a chang\u00e9 son mode de licensing pour collecter des droits, nous serions dans l'incertitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e par cette condition \"dans la mesure du possible\". Nous arrivons l\u00e0 au c\u0153ur du probl\u00e8me. On lit dans la partie Attribution les conditions de l'exploitation de la licence : 3.a.1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i.identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; La notice du copyright est \u00e9videmment la notice du copyright du propri\u00e9taire du contenu original. Ce fait est tr\u00e8s important : la licence CC4 donne le droit d'exploitation du contenu mais ne change pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce dernier. Cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 reste soumise au copyright. Or, pour les jeux de r\u00f4les, la jurisprudence am\u00e9ricaine consid\u00e8re que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne s'applique qu'\u00e0 une partie du contenu original : la partie non relative aux r\u00e8gles du jeu. Demander un copyright sur le contenu devient donc, dans le cadre des jeux, une mention ambigu\u00eb : les r\u00e8gles D20 ne sont pas sous copyright alors que le terme D20 est une trademark et les Forgotten Realms le sont. Dans le cadre d'un SRD ne publiant que des r\u00e8gles, nous avons vu ci-dessus qu'il \u00e9tait inutile de rappeler que les r\u00e8gles du SRD \u00e9taient copyright WotC alors que des r\u00e8gles ne peuvent pas porter de copyright. Il est \u00e9galement inutile de cr\u00e9diter les auteurs. iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. Voil\u00e0 ce que demande WotC dans le SRD 5.1 de D&D en version CC4 en terme de cr\u00e9dits : The System Reference Document 5.1 is provided to you free of charge under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (\u201cCC-BY-4.0\u201d). You are free to use this content in any manner permitted by that license as long as you include the following attribution statement in your own work: This work includes material taken from the System Reference Document 5.1 (\u201cSRD 5.1\u201d) by Wizards of the Coast LLC and available at https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document. The SRD 5.1 is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode. Il est tr\u00e8s amusant que WotC ne demande pas de citer son copyright . Pourquoi ? Parce que ces derniers savent que le contenu du SRD n'est pas soumis au copyright ! Il utilisent donc la fa\u00e7on courante CC4 d'attribuer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \"by WotC\" qui n'a aucune valeur juridique et qui maintient l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. Voir ici : Sometimes, the author will also provide a copyright notice, which consists of the copyright symbol, year of publication, and the name of the author/licensor. Include the copyright notice as a part of your attribution if such information is provided. Comme WotC impose des choses sur son contenu, ils auraient d\u00fb imposer de cr\u00e9diter leur copyright. Or ils ne le font pas, tout simplement parce qu'ils n'en ont pas sur cette partie. Cela signifie qu'ils savent que le point de vue d\u00e9fendu par cet article est vrai mais que, tant que les choses marchent, ils continuent \u00e0 faire illusion ! Please do not include any other attribution regarding Wizards other than that provided above. You may, however, include a statement on your work that it is \u201ccompatible with fifth edition\u201d or \u201c5E compatible.\u201d Section 5 of CC-BY-4.0 includes a Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability that limits our liability to you. Notons que, dans cette version, WotC ouvre sa simili-trademark \"5e\" ou \"Fifth Edition\", cela facilite l'identification des produits, ce qui est une bonne chose. Mais l\u00e0 encore, WotC enfonce une porte ouverte : \"5e\" ou \"Fifth edition\" ne peut pas faire l'objet d'une vraie trademark en raison de son caract\u00e8re vraiment trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rique. Seul Googman Games avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une trademark sur Fifth Edition Fantasy mais l'a abandonn\u00e9 en juin 2023. Mais revenons \u00e0 la licence CC4. 3.a.3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. Cet article pr\u00e9cise que le cr\u00e9ateur du contenu original a quand m\u00eame des droits sur ce contenu, au point de pouvoir modifier la mention. Dans la mention demand\u00e9e par WotC, mention sans copyright original, on peut assumer que WotC a implicitement utilis\u00e9 cet article pour ne pas indiquer que le contenu du SRD \u00e9tait soumis au copyright. 3.a.4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Pour la troisi\u00e8me fois, la licence indique que le contenu original est toujours sous la licence CC4 et que ce contenu doit rester sous la licence CC4. Nous dirons que nous sommes dans une \"contamination partielle\" port\u00e9e par la licence. Nous avons vu que la licence CC4 est li\u00e9e au copyright original, ce qui est normal. Cela a pour implication : Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. Voil\u00e0 la cons\u00e9quence naturelle : si les droits se terminent, la licence CC4 devient caduque et il n'est plus possible d'exploiter le contenu. Le copyright est un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par une entit\u00e9 qui a sa dur\u00e9e de vie. Comme toute licence, le possesseur du copyright peut la terminer s'il le souhaite. CC4 ou OGL, m\u00eame combat # En fait, nous en sommes au m\u00eame point. D\u00e8s lors que le contenu distribu\u00e9 par WotC n'est pas soumis au copyright, ces derniers peuvent bien le distribuer sous toutes les licences du monde. Il y a un gros c\u00f4t\u00e9 hypocrite dans le fait de distribuer ce contenu sous une licence CC4, car la licence CC4 indique que le contenu \"ouvert\" doit \u00eatre distribu\u00e9 sous licence CC4. Or c'est faux dans notre cas au titre du fait que le contenu est non soumis au copyright. Il est donc compl\u00e8tement libre. Or comme la licence CC4 impose une attribution des auteurs, elle impose une contrainte suppl\u00e9mentaire par rapport \u00e0 la nature du contenu. Elle est donc en violation avec le droit US : elle restreint l'usage d'un contenu totalement libre en obligeant \u00e0 une attribution. Notons que c'est aussi le cas de l'OGL ! Cette \"licence\" restreint l'utilisation d'un contenu public en obligeant \u00e0 cr\u00e9diter des personnes qui, au regard de la loi US, ne portent aucun copyright sur le contenu. Il est notable que WotC nous prouve, avec les mentions port\u00e9es dans le document SRD 5.1 CC4 et l'absence d'usage de son copyright dans la demande d'attribution, qu'il est au courant de l'affaire. Et pourtant... L'update qui f\u00e2che # Fin d\u00e9cembre 2022, WotC indique qu'ils travaillent sur un update de la licence , update qui va mettre des contraintes suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 la licence OGL V1.0a (voir ici ). Pour ceux qui croient \u00e0 la licence, c'est un casus belli . Et pourtant, il est n\u00e9cessaire de bien lire le draft de la nouvelle licence. Deux types de contenu dans le SRD 5.1 # Un mot de contexte : \u00e0 ce moment, le SRD 5.1 complet n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 sous licence CC4. La licence commence par une page d'introduction red\u00e9finissant les contenus dans le SRD 5.1 de D&D . Certaines parties du SRD ne seraient pas publi\u00e9s sous la licence CC4 : Les classes de personnages, Les sorts, pi\u00e8ges, maladies, folie, objets, poisons, et objets magiques, Les conditions des personnages. Pourquoi faire ces choix ? Myst\u00e8re. Surtout qu'apr\u00e8s avoir ouvert ce contenu pendant si longtemps (depuis 2016 ), il est facile de montrer que beaucoup de ces chapitres sont des r\u00e8gles et des m\u00e9caniques de jeu - donc qu'aucun copyright ne s'applique dessus. Sur ce qui reste du SRD, WotC propose de mettre une licence CC4 . Sur les parties non soumises \u00e0 la licence CC4 (voir liste ci-dessus), ce serait la licence OGL V1.2 qui s'appliquerait. Ce distinguo indique qu'en 2023, WotC d\u00e9finit les nouveaux contours d'un \"mini SRD\" reprenant toutes les r\u00e8gles auxquelles incontestablement, il est impossible d'attacher un copyright (les parties sous CC4). Si ce mini-SRD \u00e9tait cr\u00e9\u00e9, il serait possible de b\u00e2tir des jeux \u00e9ternellement libres sur cette base. C'est ce qu'a voulu faire Kobold Press avec Black Flag (voir plus loin). Suppression de la licence OGL V1.0a # L'article 9 est invoqu\u00e9 comme le craignaient tous ceux qui avaient lu la licence : NOTICE OF DEAUTHORIZATION OF OGL 1.0a. The Open Game License 1.0a is no longer an authorized license. This means that you may not use that version of the OGL, or any prior version, to publish SRD content after (effective date) . It does not mean that any content previously published under that version needs to update to this license. Any previously published content remains licensed under whichever version of the OGL was in effect when you published that content. Oui, les publications faites avant cette licence sont toujours valables, mais pas celles apr\u00e8s. La version 1.2 # Puis la licence est OGL V1.2 est d\u00e9taill\u00e9e : Open Game License 1.2 This is a License between Wizards of the Coast LLC (\u201cWizards,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d) and anyone who wants to use the licensed content in their own TTRPG (\u201cyou,\u201d \u201cyour\u201d). By using Our Licensed Content, you agree to the terms of this license. As used in this license, \u201cwe\u201d (or any other term referring to us) includes our affiliates, successors, and predecessors. Le p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de la licence est beaucoup moins vague qu'auparavant : WotC s'adresse aux cr\u00e9ateurs de JDR. \u00a71. LICENSED CONTENT (a) Content Covered (i) Our Licensed Content. This license covers any content in the SRD 5.1 (or any subsequent version of the SRD we release under this license) that is not licensed to you under Creative Commons. You may use that content in your own works on the terms of this license. Le contenu sorti de la licence CC4 est le Licenced Content. (ii) Our Unlicensed Content. Only Our Licensed Content is licensed under this license. Any other content we release or have released is not licensed to you under this license. Nouvelle notion : unlicensed content , tous les autres contenus sans licence ne sont, \u00e9videmment, pas utilisables. (iii) Your Content. This is your creative contributions to your works that are not Our Licensed Content or Our Unlicensed Content. This license permits you to combine Your Content with Our Licensed Content and distribute the resulting works as authorized by this license. On aurait pu dire Derived Works comme dans le droit am\u00e9ricain sur le copyright. (b) Works Covered. This license only applies to printed media and static electronic files (such as epubs or pdfs) you create for use in or as tabletop roleplaying games and supplements (\u201cTTRPGs\u201d) and in virtual tabletops in accordance with our Virtual Tabletop Policy (\u201cVTTs\u201d). (c) Your Licensed Works. To be a Licensed Work under this license, it must: (i) be a covered work as defined in Section 1(b); (ii) contain both Our Licensed Content and Your Content; and (iii) not contain Our Unlicensed Content. Cette d\u00e9finition est redondante avec ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit avant. (d) Copyrights. We are only licensing you our copyrights in Our Licensed Content, except that under Section 5(a) we also grant you a trademark license to the Creator Product badge, as further detailed in the Creator Product Badge Style Guide. You receive no other rights to our trademarks, and no rights to any other intellectual property we own. En termes de contenus, nous allons voir les restrictions. En termes de forme, WotC voulait imposer une forme sp\u00e9ciale aux suppl\u00e9ments des cr\u00e9ateurs, comme ce que l'on peut trouver sur D&D Beyond ou DMs Guild. Cette contrainte est totalement inacceptable pour des \u00e9diteurs de jeux tierces qui ont toujours eu leur propre visuel et leur propre gestion artistique. De plus, cette contrainte artistique est bien adapt\u00e9e pour les petits sc\u00e9narios publi\u00e9s sur les plateformes en ligne telles D&D Beyond ou DMs Guild, mais pas pour les nouveaux jeux. Il \u00e9tait normal que cette nouvelle version provoque un toll\u00e9. \u00a72. LICENSE. In consideration for your compliance with this license, you may copy, use, modify and distribute Our Licensed Content around the world as part of Your Licensed Works. This license is perpetual (meaning that it has no set end date), non-exclusive (meaning that we may offer others a license to Our Licensed Content or Our Unlicensed Content under any conditions we choose), and irrevocable (meaning that content licensed under this license can never be withdrawn from the license). It also cannot be modified except for the attribution provisions of Section 5 and Section 9(a) regarding notices. Cette garantie est fausse. Dans le droit am\u00e9ricain, une licence d'utilisation peut s'arr\u00eater. Le sujet est : est-ce que cette licence porte que des contenus sous copyright ? D'ailleurs, WotC aurait pu aller plus loin et rendre invendable les produits sous licence OGL V1.0a. \u00a73. WHAT YOU OWN. Your Licensed Works are yours. They may not be copied or used without your permission. Excellent ! WotC donne des le\u00e7ons de copyright aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la licence ! On aura tout vu. You acknowledge that we and our licensees, as content creators ourselves, might independently come up with content similar to something you create. If you have a claim that we breached this provision, or that one of our licensees did in connection with content they licensed from us: (a) Any such claim will be brought only as a lawsuit for breach of contract, and only for money damages. You expressly agree that money damages are an adequate remedy for such a breach, and that you will not seek or be entitled to injunctive relief. C'est incroyable ! WotC demande aux r\u00e9cipiendaires des licences de s'engager sur les types de recours qu'ils pourraient faire dans des cas de soup\u00e7ons de plagiat de la part de WotC ou d'un autre r\u00e9cipiendaire... Cette mention est parfaitement contraire au droit du copyright qui autorise toutes sortes de recours en cas de plagiat. En d'autres termes WotC demande aux r\u00e9cipiendaires de la licence de s'engager \u00e0 ne pas avoir recours \u00e0 tous les moyens juridiques \u00e0 leur disposition. N'importe quoi. (b) In any such lawsuit, you must show that we knowingly and intentionally copied your Licensed Work. Access and substantial similarity will not be enough to prove a breach of this Section 3. Ils ne manquent pas d'air et veulent faire le proc\u00e8s et ses conclusions dans la licence. Hasbro et WotC sont-ils au courant qu'ils sont dans un \u00e9tat souverain avec des lois auxquelles ils sont soumis ? \u00a74. WHAT WE OWN. We own Our Licensed Content and reserve all rights not expressly granted in this license. N-i\u00e8me redite de la m\u00eame chose. \u00a75. YOU CONTROL YOUR CONTENT. You can make your Content available under any terms you choose C'est une nouveaut\u00e9 bienvenue en comparaison des sous-entendus de la version 1.0a. Oui, dans le cadre de la loi sur le copyright, il est possible de faire les licences et les transferts de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que le possesseur de la licence souhaite. but you may not change the terms under which we make Our Licensed Content available. Le contenu original de WotC reste en licence OGL V1.2. (a) You must clearly indicate that your Licensed Work contains Our Licensed Content under this license either by including the full text of this license in your Licensed Work or by applying the Creator Products badge in compliance with the then-current style guidelines. Clairement, WotC demandait des choses inacceptables quant au style impos\u00e9 sur les \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es. Il serait int\u00e9ressant de consulter un sp\u00e9cialiste du droit du copyright pour savoir s'il est possible de donner l'usage d'un contenu tout en contraignant la forme. De ce que j'ai lu, je ne me souviens pas d'avoir vu ce genre de contraintes (\u00e0 part la mise en place d'un logo par exemple). Il n'est pas certain que cette clause de forme soit d\u00e9fendable en proc\u00e8s et ne soit pas, pour des produits aussi artistiques que les livres de JDR d'aujourd'hui, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme inacceptable et remettant en cause le Product Identity du r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence. (b) You may permit the use of your Content on any terms you want. However, if any license you offer to your Licensed Work is different from the terms of this license, you must include in the Licensed Work the attribution for Our Licensed Content found in the preamble to the applicable SRD, and make clear that Our Licensed Content included in your Licensed Work is made available on the terms of this license. Cette demande est l\u00e9gitime et conforme au droit du copyright et des \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es. \u00a76. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS. You represent and warrant that: (a) Age and Capacity to Be Bound. You are over the age of majority or, if younger, have had your parent or guardian review these terms and agree to them on your behalf. Etrange remarque dans un contrat. (b) Authority. You have the power and authority to enter into this license and perform its obligations. (c) No Infringement. Your Licensed Works do not and will not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights or any of our rights not licensed to you via this license or any other. WotC tente de se prot\u00e9ger, mais en faisant signer des d\u00e9clarations vagues. (d) No Endorsement. Except as otherwise expressly allowed by this license, you will not state, suggest, or imply that Your Licensed Works are endorsed by or associated with us. Mention classique. (e) No Illegal Conduct. You will not violate the law in any way relating to this license or Your Licensed Works. Cette mention a au moins le m\u00e9rite de la na\u00efvet\u00e9. (f) No Hateful Content or Conduct. You will not include content in Your Licensed Works that is harmful, discriminatory, illegal, obscene, or harassing, or engage in conduct that is harmful, discriminatory, illegal, obscene, or harassing. We have the sole right to decide what conduct or content is hateful, and you covenant that you will not contest any such determination via any suit or other legal action. Cette contrainte, encore une fois, est inacceptable. Il n'appartient pas \u00e0 WotC \u00e0 juger du respect de la loi. Cette partie 6 a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 absurde. Dans la partie Warranty g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui licencie son contenu doit se prot\u00e9ger en disant que tout ce qui peut arriver n'est pas de sa faute, en gros que tout ce qui peut se faire de mal avec son contenu n'est plus de sa responsabilit\u00e9. En lieu et place, WotC fait signer un contrat d'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 une plateforme de type r\u00e9seau social en obligeant les r\u00e9cipiendaires de licences \u00e0 accepter des r\u00e8gles dont ils doivent rendre compte devant WotC. C'est une confusion des genres. \u00a77 MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION (a) Modification. We may only modify the provisions of this license identifying the attribution required under Section 5 and the notice provision of Section 9(a). We may not modify any other provision. Cette d\u00e9claration n'a aucune valeur. (b) Termination (i) We may immediately terminate your license if you infringe any of our intellectual property; bring an action challenging our ownership of Our Licensed Content, trademarks, or patents; violate any law in relation to your activities under this license; or violate Section 6(f). Oui comme dans un r\u00e9seau social. (ii) We may terminate your license if you breach any other term in this license, and do not cure that breach within 30 days of notice to you of the breach. \u00a78. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE LICENSED CONTENT \u201cAS IS\u201d AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND CONCERNING YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED CONTENT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. YOU BEAR ALL RISK OF USING THE LICENSED CONTENT AND SUCH USE IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK. We have no liability to you for any types of damages in connection with your use of Our Licensed Content including without limitation any indirect, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, so long as our conduct at issue was not grossly negligent or intentional. Voil\u00e0 la fameuse mention que nous mentionnions auparavant. Elle est totalement suffisante dans une licence en lieu et place de la section 6. \u00a79.MISCELLANEOUS (a) Notices. We may notify you by any email or physical address we can locate for you. Only if we cannot locate your email or physical address after a reasonable search, notice via a public channel is sufficient. You may provide notice to us of your email or physical address, or any other notice, by emailing oglnotices@wizards.com. (b) Entire Agreement and Disclaimer of Reliance. This license governs your use of Our Licensed Content. This license consists only of the terms expressly included herein, and not any matter not expressly included herein. In accepting this license, you represent and warrant to us that you have relied only on the terms of the license and the advice of your own counsel, if any; you have not relied on anything that is not expressly a part of this license. Verbiage pseudo-juridique redondant avec de multiples endroits dans cette licence. (c) No Waiver of Rights. If we fail to exercise any right we have under this license, that failure will not prevent us from exercising that right in the future. Cela ne veut rien dire. (d) Severability. If any part of this license is held to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, Wizards may declare the entire license void, either as between it and the party that obtained the ruling or in its entirety. Unless Wizards elects to do so, the balance of this license will be enforced as if that part which is unenforceable or invalid did not exist. On sent que les personnes qui ont \u00e9crit cette licence n'ont pas confiance en eux. (e) Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Class Action Waiver. This license and all matters relating to its interpretation and enforcement will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and any disputes arising out of or relating to this license will be resolved solely and exclusively through individual litigation in the state or federal courts located in the county in which Wizards (or any successor) has its headquarters, and the parties expressly consent to the jurisdiction of such courts. Each party hereto irrevocably waives the right to participate in any class, collective, or other joint action with respect to such a dispute. N'importe quoi. Encore une fois, WotC ne peut pas faire signer \u00e0 quelqu'un qu'il s'engage \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 ses droits l\u00e9gaux en cas de litige. C'est absurde. Il s'agit probablement d'une clause copi\u00e9e et coll\u00e9e d'un contrat commercial entre deux entreprises, clause totalement hors sujet dans le cadre de cette licence. (f) Headings and Footnotes. The headings and footnotes contained in this license are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this license. Mention inutile. (g) Waiver of Jury Trial. We and you each waive any right to a jury trial of any dispute, claim or cause of action related to or arising out of this license. M\u00eame remarque qu'auparavant. Il est impossible de renoncer \u00e0 ses droits l\u00e9gaux dans le cadre d'une licence. (h) Review by Counsel. You should seek advice of counsel to make sure you understand this license. You agree that you had the opportunity to do so. Mention parfaitement stupide. Confusion \u00e0 tous les \u00e9tages # Osons le dire, ce draft for discussion purposes est un torchon ! Il faut absolument que WotC fasse appel \u00e0 des gens comp\u00e9tents en droit du copyright, car ce \"truc\" est la preuve d'une incomp\u00e9tence juridique crasse. Une fois de plus, WotC \u00e9tait en pleine confusion, voire en plein d\u00e9lire : Confusion de logique : Quel lien entre le contenu prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l'OGL V2.0 et la licence elle-m\u00eame ? Quel lien entre le contenu CC4 et le contenu lui-m\u00eame ? Il n'y a aucune logique. Pourquoi ce d\u00e9coupage ? Certains monstres ont une origine tr\u00e8s ancienne dans D&D , alors pourquoi ne figurent-ils pas dans les \u00e9l\u00e9ments non CC4 de la licence ? Confusion de compr\u00e9hension de la nature des contenus Vouloir prot\u00e9ger un contenu qu'on a ouvert pendant tr\u00e8s longtemps signifie que l'on a mesur\u00e9 le risque juridique de se faire attaquer sur ce point car, pendant des ann\u00e9es (au moins entre 2016 et 2023 soit pendant 7 ans), les gens ont pris l'habitude d'utiliser ce contenu gratuitement. Il y a eu la mise en place d'un usage r\u00e9gulier . Le risque juridique aurait donc \u00e9t\u00e9 que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s attaquent WotC pour d\u00e9montrer que les contenus nouvellement \"ferm\u00e9s\" par la licence OGL V2.0 \u00e9taient en fait des r\u00e8gles du jeu sur lesquelles aucun copyright ne pouvait \u00eatre pos\u00e9. Comme illustration, regardons n'importe quelle classe de personnages, contenu nouvellement ferm\u00e9 dans la licence OGL V2.0, et osons dire que ce n'est pas une r\u00e8gle. Confusion business : WotC a-t-il r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'une oeuvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e doit pouvoir s'exprimer par la forme et donc qu'une contrainte sur la forme est inacceptable ? Une licence d'utilisation d'un contenu ne peut pas \u00eatre contrainte \u00e0 une forme, mais \u00e9ventuellement le respect d'un esprit (dans le cadre de licences exclusives). Si trop de contraintes sont ajout\u00e9es, la licence devient un contrat de prestation pour le compte de WotC, mais ce n'est plus un contrat de licence. Cela pose le probl\u00e8me des contrats sign\u00e9s par les utilisateurs des plateformes comme DMS Guild qui imposent une forme sp\u00e9ciale. Depuis ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, D&D Beyond s'est mis \u00e0 publier du contenu de tierces parties sans imposer ces contraintes. Confusions l\u00e9gales : Il n'est pas possible dans le cadre d'une licence de faire signer aux r\u00e9cipiendaires des renonciations \u00e0 leurs droits l\u00e9gaux, ni de contraindre \u00e0 pr\u00e9-choisir des modes d'attaques ou de d\u00e9fense en cas de proc\u00e8s. Il n'est pas possible de d\u00e9terminer par avance l'issue de potentielles attaques, par exemple dans le cas d'un plagiat. Ces litiges doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9solus par les tribunaux dans l'exercice plein et entier du droit am\u00e9ricain. Confusion de textes l\u00e9gaux : on trouve dans cette licences des \u00e9l\u00e9ments venant de multiples sources : Des licences de type CC4, Des conditions d'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 un service Internet en ligne (type D&D Beyond), Des clauses qui ressemblent \u00e0 celles d'un contrat de travail, Des clauses contractuelles \u00e9tablies dans le cadre d'un accord entre deux compagnies. Ce document est une honte pour le monde du JDR tant l'incomp\u00e9tence des gens ayant travaill\u00e9 sur ce dossier est patente. De plus, au regard de son caract\u00e8re propre \u00e0 tuer le business, il est normal que la licence OGL V2.0 ait suscit\u00e9 l'ire des compagnies exploitant la licence OGL v1.0a. Conclusion de l'affaire # Devant la lev\u00e9e de boucliers, WotC se d\u00e9cide \u00e0 publier le SRD 5.1 dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 en version OGL V1.0a et en version CC-BY-4.0 (CC4). Cette position est parfaitement incoh\u00e9rente : dans CC4, tout le contenu est ouvert, alors que dans le clauses de la licence OGL, les sorts par exemple ne figurent pas dans les \u00e9l\u00e9ments ouverts (alors qu'ils sont dans le SRD) ! WotC n'est pas \u00e0 une b\u00eatise pr\u00e8s. Un tel niveau d'incomp\u00e9tence est quand m\u00eame rarement vu. Peur des proc\u00e8s # Ce que l'on peut dire, c'est que, faisant partie du groupe Hasbro, WotC est vu comme une grosse maison disposant de moyens \u00e9normes, notamment juridiques. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9s leurs moyens, ce mastodonte du jeu fait peur \u00e0 toute la communaut\u00e9. Et portant, 2023 nous montre que : Les comp\u00e9tences juridiques ne sont pas au rendez-vous, car personne de comp\u00e9tent n'a pu dignement drafter cette licence ; WotC semble avoir une peur panique des proc\u00e8s, alors que tout le monde a peur, dans le cadre de l'OGL, d'enfreindre des copyrights et de se faire attaquer par WotC, ce qui est un peu ironique ; WotC n'a aucune strat\u00e9gie claire concernant l'OGL ou les liens avec les compagnies utilisant cette licence (m\u00eame si en 2024, des \u00e9diteurs tiers commencent \u00e0 mettre leur produits compatibles 5e sur D&D Beyond) ; Certaines personnes de WotC doivent savoir que le contenu SRD 5.1 est sans doute non soumis au copyright dans sa quasi-totalit\u00e9, tandis que d'autres aimeraient croire et faire croire le contraire. WotC est une belle machine pour sortir des livres physiques et des PDF, pour exploiter aussi des contenus en ligne, mais le reste montre de gros manques en termes de strat\u00e9gie et de comp\u00e9tences. Suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements dans le monde OGL en janvier 2023 # La communaut\u00e9 OGL a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de panique quand des informations ont fait part de la volont\u00e9 de WotC de r\u00e9voquer la licence OGL V1.0a. La licence ORC et ses diff\u00e9rences avec l'OGL V1.0a # Certaines entreprises de jeux contestant la licence OGL dans le monde du JdR, Kobold Press, Paizo et Chaosium, entre autres, se sont alli\u00e9es pour cr\u00e9er une autre licence : ORC . La licence d\u00e9finit essentiellement les contours entre trois types de contenus : Le contenu sur lequel il n'est pas possible de mettre un copyright (pour faire simple toutes les r\u00e8gles) ; Le contenu prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ( Reserved Material ) qu'il n'est pas possible de copier sans l'autorisation des auteurs ; Le contenu \"ouvert\" ( Licensed Material ) dont il est possible de d\u00e9river des choses. Par d\u00e9faut : Tout ce qui est r\u00e8gles du jeu (au sens large) est public ; Tout ce qui est li\u00e9 \u00e0 des lieux, des personnages, etc. est \"priv\u00e9\" ; il faut donc sp\u00e9cifier ce que la licence couvre pour \"ouvrir un contenu prot\u00e9g\u00e9\". On revient aux fondamentaux de la loi sur le copyright. La notice ORC est assez bien structur\u00e9e car elle distingue bien tous les types de contenus : Le texte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que du Congr\u00e8s am\u00e9ricain et, en cela, est suppos\u00e9 durer (tr\u00e8s) longtemps sans \u00eatre alt\u00e9r\u00e9. Il est poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par Azora Law , un cabinet d'avocats de Seattle, suppos\u00e9 garder une certaine neutralit\u00e9 dans le sujet des licences. Il est possible de faire un petit tableau comparatif entre OGL et ORC : Type de contenu OGL V1.0a ORC V1.0 R\u00e8gles du jeu Open Game Content Licensed Material Contenu non ouvert Product Identity Reserved Material Contenu ouvert Open Game Content Expressly Designated Licensed Material R\u00e9f\u00e9rence de filiation Amendement de la Copyright notice (article 15) Notice compl\u00e8te \u00e0 4 sections Texte de la licence Poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par WotC Poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par Azora Law P\u00e9rennit\u00e9 de la licence Article 9 **non p\u00e9renne** Article V. b. \"**p\u00e9renne**\" Sur les trois premiers param\u00e8tres, les deux licences sont tr\u00e8s proches. En ce qui concerne la filiation, la licence ORC est plus pr\u00e9cise. En ce qui concerne le risque juridique que WotC remette en cause la licence OGL, tout est li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 9 (voir analyse un peu plus haut dans la page). Encore une fois, plusieurs points sont \u00e0 noter. La licence ORC entend clairement s'attaquer \u00e0 l'article 9 de la licence OGL V1.0a, le fameux article qui indique que WotC peut changer sa licence, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9 avec la version 2.0. La volont\u00e9 est clairement de rendre \"\u00e9ternelle\" cette ouverture de contenu : V.b. Modifications. This ORC License may not be amended, superseded, modified, updated, repealed, revoked, or deauthorized. Neither You nor Licensor may modify the terms of this ORC License; however, You may enter into a separate agreement of Your own making provided such agreement does not seek to modify the terms hereof. This ORC License does not, and shall not be interpreted to reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this ORC License. On comprend bien l'intention. Pour autant, cette intention est un v\u0153u pieu par rapport au droit US. Nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9 mais le d\u00e9tenteur d'un copyright poss\u00e8de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce copyright. Quand il d\u00e9finit une licence non exclusive, cette derni\u00e8re n'est valide que dans certaines conditions, conditions qui peuvent changer. Il n'est donc pas plus possible de garantir la p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 de la licence avec ORC qu'avec CC4.Nous ne parlons bien entendu pas de la p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 du texte de la licence, mais des objets qui sont couverts par elle. La particularit\u00e9 de ce dossier est que le contenu lui-m\u00eame ne peut pas \u00eatre soumis au copyright donc nous parlons pour rien. Bien entendu, peu de gens ont int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 lever l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du copyright li\u00e9 aux r\u00e8gles. Au contraire, beaucoup de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 se prot\u00e9ger derri\u00e8re des licences m\u00eame si ces derni\u00e8res sont bancales ou juste inapplicables. Au niveau de leurs investisseurs, cela peut rassurer. Mais pourquoi r\u00e9inventer une CC4 ? # C'est un peu la question qu'on peut l\u00e9gitimement se poser, surtout apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t par WotC de tout le SRD 5.1 en CC4. Car, au final, si l'article 9 de la licence OGL V1.0a est vis\u00e9, autant prendre une licence qui existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 et qui n'est pas poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par WotC. Certes, la licence ORC est plus pr\u00e9cise en distinguant bien les trois types de contenus, mais est-ce si important ? Car la vraie question derri\u00e8re toute cette histoire est quand m\u00eame : est-il important qu'une licence soit poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par celui qui l'utilise pour ouvrir son contenu ? Parce que, si nous revenons aux fondamentaux, regardons ce que font les ayant-droits de Tolkien avec leurs licences exclusives JDR : Ils signent des accords du dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e avec des entreprises de jeu ; Ils doivent sans doute mettre des crit\u00e8res sur les produits d\u00e9riv\u00e9s, notamment le respect de l'\u0153uvre, du monde, etc. ; Ils n\u00e9gocient des royalties ; Il est probable que la licence poss\u00e8de des conditions de sortie pr\u00e9matur\u00e9es pour le cas o\u00f9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des licences s'av\u00e8re incomp\u00e9tente ou en faillite par exemple. Certes, WotC ne publie pas ses contenus Product Identity en publiant un SRD en CC4, mais il est quand m\u00eame normal que cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 elle veut le faire, que ce soit pour de bonnes ou de mauvaises raisons, d\u00e9crive les termes qui l'arrangent dans la mesure o\u00f9 il se peut qu'elle croie honn\u00eatement (ce dont je doute mais supposons) qu'elle permette \u00e0 l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me de profiter de son IP ( Intellectual Property ) gratuitement. Dans la d\u00e9marche, l'utilisation en cascade de la licence OGL est un peu \u00e9trange, car un certain nombre de termes de cette licence ne sont pas adapt\u00e9s aux \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es, mais il n'est pas choquant que, si on suppose que WotC cro\u00eet partager son copyright, ces derniers s'arrogent le droit (qu'ils ont du fait de la loi sur le copyright !) de changer la licence voire de la rendre obsol\u00e8te (cf. article 9). Pour ce qui est des autres compagnies, que cherchent-elles vraiment ? Si elles cherchent \u00e0 construire sur un socle fiable dans le temps, ces derni\u00e8res risqueront toujours de suivre WotC qui, en raison de ses marques et de son aura, et aussi d'une bonne qualit\u00e9 de ses produits, reconnaissons-le, aura toujours une version d'avance. Pour ceux qui ont mis\u00e9 sur le D20 voil\u00e0 20 ans et sur le SRD 3.5, ils peuvent continuer de tenter de vendre des produits, car c'est possible. Ce n'est jute plus vendable... ...Plus vendable hormis pour Paizo qui, avec Pathfinder 2e, a fait le choix de rester dans la lign\u00e9e du SRD 3.5 avec une nouvelle branche qui enl\u00e8ve toute mention ambigu\u00eb pouvant les taxer d'atteinte au copyright de WotC. C'est finalement peut-\u00eatre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 la plus sens\u00e9e dans cette histoire car elle a vis\u00e9 le fond du probl\u00e8me : r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer toutes les r\u00e8gles qu'elle voulait, car ces r\u00e8gles \u00e9taient du domaine public, et changer les d\u00e9nominations pour \u00e9viter toute exposition \u00e0 un potentiel risque de Product Identity. Elle peut donc maintenant travailler sans d\u00e9pendance par rapport \u00e0 WotC. Pour autant, les r\u00e8gles de Pathfinder 2e, elles-aussi, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre soumises au copyright ! Mais les autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, que veulent-elles \u00e0 part vouloir vendre des produits 5e avec le contenu du SRD 5.1 ouvert, pas de royalties et pas de risque juridique ? Regardons le sujet de plus pr\u00e8s. Ouverture de BRP 5e en ORC # D\u00e9but 2024, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Chaosium a publi\u00e9 quasiment toute la 5e du Basic RolePlaying (BRP) system en ORC. Il est donc possible de voir cette publication comme, une fois de plus, une ligne trac\u00e9e entre ce qui est du contenu sans copyright d'un contenu avec copyright. Au moins, les choses sont clairement exprim\u00e9es et \u00e9crites. Le SRD l\u00e8ve donc l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du m\u00e9lange des contenus et s'aligne, en cela, comme nous ne cessons de le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, avec la loi US sur le copyright. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, c'est le lot des syst\u00e8mes de jeu g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ( BRP , GURPS , D&D , etc.) d'avoir une tr\u00e8s grosse partie de leur contenu publiable en mode SRD - sans copyright. Je sais que c'est le cauchemar de Steve Jackson de GURPS mais un jour, la baudruche se d\u00e9gonflera... Faute de mieux et histoire de demander \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 d'\u00eatre fair play avec les inventeurs, citer la filiation est un acte de bonne conduite que les licences OGL, CC-BY-V4.0 et ORC veulent rendre obligatoire. Mais si l'acte est moralement bon, il ne figure pas dans les obligations l\u00e9gales de la loi sur le copyright. Chaosium n'est pas en concurrence avec WotC, on pourrait m\u00eame que ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont eu des int\u00e9r\u00eats communs du temps de Call of Cthulhu D20. Pour Chaosium qui veut, je pense, continuer de jouer sur cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles sans copyright et du mat\u00e9riel prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par ledit copyright, c'est une fa\u00e7on de tenter de faire comme WotC, de faire fructifier un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me qui, au final, fait de la publicit\u00e9 pour un syst\u00e8me de jeu et dynamise les ventes. Que la licence soit ORC ou CC4 n'a que peu d'importance. Il \u00e9tait tellement tentant de surfer sur la vague d'indignation caus\u00e9e par l'OGL V2.0. Apr\u00e8s tout, comme on dit l\u00e0-bas : It's only business . Black Flag et Tales of the Valiant # Les plus \u00e9nerv\u00e9s par les rumeurs sur WotC et la licence OGL en janvier 2023 ont sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 les Kobold Press . Ils ont annonc\u00e9 assez vite que vivre avec cette \u00e9p\u00e9e de Damocl\u00e8s au dessus de la t\u00eate \u00e9tait insupportable et qu'ils allaient cr\u00e9er un socle de jeu de type 5e qui serait ORC et que tout le monde pourrait construire de mani\u00e8re fiable et long terme en d\u00e9rivant de ce contenu. Le r\u00e9sultat s'appelle Black Flag et le Reference Document peut \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 ici .

If you use our Licensed Material in your own published works, please credit us as follows: Black Flag Roleplaying Reference Document v0.1, \u00a9 Open Design, LLC d/b/a Kobold Press Kobold Press remplit les exigences de la licence ORC sur la demande \u00e0 ses \"descendants\" de faire une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur le contenu original. Notons que ces derniers ont appos\u00e9 leur copyright sur le r\u00e9sultat ! Quel toupet, alors que le copyright ne porte que sur les innovations de Kobold Press... Alors, en tant que cr\u00e9ateur de jeu, j'inclue leur mention dans mon jeu mais avec ou sans la mention du SRD de D&D ? Nous sommes typiquement dans le cas de C si l'on regarde le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus. Alors, refaisons encore une fois le parcours : Si le contenu du SRD 5.1 et le contenu de Kobold Press sont soumis au copyright, alors la licence est valide et je dois avoir une licence pour les deux, CC4 pour le SRD 5.1 et Orc pour le contenu Kobold Press. Car bien entendu, Kobold Press n'a pas le droit de changer la licence CC4 du SRD 5.1 par une distribution sous licence ORC. Il faut donc les deux licences. Si le contenu n'est que compos\u00e9 de r\u00e8gles, ce que je pense \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, alors je peux tout copier et en faire ce que je veux sans citer personne. Compliqu\u00e9, n'est-il pas ? Reserved Material: Reserved Material elements in this product include all elements designated as Reserved Material under the ORC License. Expressly Designated Licensed Material: This product contains no Expressly Designated Licensed Material. Consid\u00e9rant que le document Black Flag ne contient aucune mention explicite \u00e0 du Reserved Material , tout ce qui n'est pas m\u00e9canique de jeu (au sens de la licence ORC) peut donc \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 du contenu sous copyright. La derni\u00e8re phrase ent\u00e9rine ce fait en insistant sur le fait qu'il n'y a pas, en dehors du contenu r\u00e8gles et assimil\u00e9, de contenu sous copyright explicitement ouvert. Une lecture rapide de Black Flag permet de voir que le contenu est une version simplifi\u00e9e du SRD 5.1 de D&D plus quelques innovations de r\u00e8gles (la r\u00e8gle \"Doom\" par exemple). Il faut un peu de toupet pour apposer un copyright \u00e0 ce jeu qui ne s'appuie sur aucune trademark ! Black Flag doit servir de fondation au jeu Tales of the Valiant . Par cette manipulation de licences, Kobold Press veut construire sur une base ouverte inattaquable et inalt\u00e9rable lui permettant d'exploiter le contenu de WotC. Il veut aussi \"donner\" cela \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9. C'est une approche \"ceinture et bretelles\" mais qui maintient l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 sur la nature du contenu du SRD 5.1. En prenant uniquement un extrait de ce contenu, les Kobold Press entendent d\u00e9finir \u00e0 leur tour ce qui n'est vraiment pas, de mani\u00e8re certaine, soumis au copyright. Faire cela revient un peu \u00e0 faire la m\u00eame chose que ce qu'a fait Paizo pour Pathfinder 2e, au risque de s'accrocher \u00e0 une version de D&D qui va vieillir rapidement. Nous sommes en 2024 et la nouvelle version des trois manuels arrivera vers l'automne de cette ann\u00e9e. Mais tout cela n'est-il pas que du th\u00e9\u00e2tre ? Kobold Press, apr\u00e8s tout, vient juste de rentrer sur D&D Beyond (depuis le 21 mars 2024) pour vendre son Tome of Beast ... Le leader des ennemis devenant premier partenaire ? Hum... Conclusion # Il n'est pas possible que certains acteurs du JDR am\u00e9ricains n'aient pas compris depuis longtemps que cette licence OGL \u00e9tait \"creuse\" du fait que le contenu distribu\u00e9 par WotC ne puisse pas \u00eatre soumis au copyright. La pol\u00e9mique de janvier 2023 sur les licences est \u00e0 l'image de l'absurdit\u00e9 de ce dossier : Si le contenu du SRD 5.1 est soumis au copyright, alors WotC a le droit de r\u00e9silier tous les accords de licence qu'il a pass\u00e9s quand il le souhaite. Si l'on cro\u00eet \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la licence, on ne doit pas critiquer la tentative affligeante de la licence OGL V2.0. Si le contenu du SRD 5.1 n'est pas soumis au copyright, alors qu'importe la licence OGL et les gesticulations de la communaut\u00e9 ? Il est certain que certaines personnes chez WotC ont compris depuis longtemps que le contenu du SRD n'\u00e9tait pas soumis au copyright, et pour des gens si rigoureux dans le fait de montrer la diff\u00e9rence entre leur \"Product Identity\" et le reste, la non utilisation du copyright dans la licence CC4 est un vrai signe. material [...] by WotC et non pas : material [...] copyright WotC Quand, \u00e0 la suite de la lev\u00e9e de boucliers contre la licence OGL V2.0, la communaut\u00e9 du JDR pousse des cris d'orfraie, que tous font des moulinets, crient, se p\u00e2ment, cr\u00e9ent une autre licence, pour \"se rassurer\", tout \u00e7a pour que quelques uns se retrouvent sur D&D Beyond un an apr\u00e8s (avec un accord de royalties qui doit \u00eatre sympa pour WotC), on se dit qu'on est vraiment en plein jeu de r\u00f4les ! Et que le MJ se fout bien de notre gueule ! Annexes # Rapide analyse de la licence Cepheus engine # Le Cepheus engine est une version \u00e9tendue du moteur de Traveller . Il est disponible en ligne gratuitement depuis pas mal de temps. Le document est aussi sur DriveThru en \"pay what you want\". Il est publi\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 2016. Un sujet de licences # L'id\u00e9e de l'auteur, Jason \"Flynn\" Kemp, \u00e9tait de reprendre pas mal de contenus OGC et d'en faire le socle d'un jeu de SF ambitieux pouvant \u00eatre \u00e9tendu \u00e0 l'infini tout en restant compatible avec Traveller . Note introductive # Ci-dessous est la note introductive au jeu. Please Note: This Product is derived from the Traveller System Reference Document and other Open Gaming Content made available by the Open Gaming License, and does not contain closed content from products published by either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises. La premi\u00e8re phrase est assez vague. Etant donn\u00e9 que les contenus sous copyright appartiennent \u00e0 leurs auteurs, il est requis de mentionner ces auteurs, \u00e0 moins que ce ne soit des r\u00e8gles auquel cas il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de le faire. L'expression \"other Open Gaming Content\" ne rassure donc pas. This Product is not affiliated with either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises, and it makes no claim to or challenge to any trademarks held by either entity. The use of the Traveller System Reference Document does not convey the endorsement of this Product by either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises as a product of either of their product lines. Ce genre d'avertissement est assez courant car demand\u00e9 par les licences : La publication n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec le cr\u00e9ateur original du contenu ; La publication n'enfreint pas de trademark. Le choix de l'auteur : ceinture et bretelles # On voit \u00e0 la fin de l'ouvrage que l'auteur Jason \"Flynn\" Kemp h\u00e9site entre deux positions et finalement, il prend les deux (!) : Il inclue la licence OGL V1.0a qui est juste hors sujet, en disant qu'il faut l'appliquer quand elle s'applique (\"if the terms apply\"), ce qui a le m\u00e9rite de montrer qu'il voit qu'elle n'est pas adapt\u00e9e ; Et il inclue sa propre licence (\"The Cepheus Engine Compatibility-Statement License (CSL)\") qui d\u00e9finit vraiment ce qu'il a en t\u00eate. Une fois encore, on peut r\u00e9aliser que 16 ans apr\u00e8s la publication de la licence OGL V1.0a par WotC, la confusion est toujours grandement pr\u00e9sente dans la communaut\u00e9 du JDR sur ces questions de licences ! La pr\u00e9sence de la licence OGL V1.0a sur Cepheus est tout bonnement absurde, car Traveller n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec D&D . Evidemment, comme le SRD de Traveller , version Mongoose, \u00e9tait sous OGL V1.0a, ce qui est tout aussi stupide, Jason Kemp a d\u00fb se sentir oblig\u00e9 de mettre cette licence. Malgr\u00e9 sa formule \"if the terms apply\", un bon juriste pourrait d\u00e9monter la licence facilement en disant qu, au final, il n'y aucune consigne claire sur ce qui est ou non applicable. La licence \"CSL\" # Jetons un petit coup d'\u0153il \u00e0 la licence Cepheus . The Cepheus Engine Compatibility-Statement License (CSL) \u00a71. You must state on the first page where you mention Cepheus Engine that \u201cCepheus Engine and Samardan Press are the trademarks of Jason \"Flynn\" Kemp,\u201d and that you are not affiliated with Jason \"Flynn\" Kemp or Samardan Press\u2122. La protection des trademarks est une obligation l\u00e9gale \u00e0 la loi US. Petit probl\u00e8me : Ni Cepheus, ni Samardan ne sont des marques d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aux US. Je serait le sieur Jason, je me ferai du souci. \u00a72. If you\u2019re using the license to commit legal fraud, you forfeit the right to continue using the license: specifically, if you are claiming compatibility with the rules of Cepheus Engine, the claim must not constitute legal fraud, or fraud in the inducement, under the laws of the State of Texas. Note that this requirement is almost impossible to violate unintentionally\u2014it\u2019s largely intended to keep me out of trouble, not to restrict legitimate statements of compatibility. La licence ne doit pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour des fraudes ou pour mettre \u00e0 risque l'auteur original. Si c'est le cas, la licence n'est plus valide. \u00a73. You must comply with the terms of the OGL if the terms apply. Ca ne veut rien dire mais \u00e7a ne mange pas de pain (voir plus haut). \u00a74. Your cover must include the words \u201cHouse Rules\u201d or \u201cVariant Rules\u201d or \"Alternate Cepheus Engine Universe\" near the title if the document is a full, free-standing game that includes modifications. Feel free to contact the author if you wish to use a different form of disclaimer. C'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 nous voyons que les choses ne sont pas claires pour les auteurs. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 un tiers copie les r\u00e8gles de Cepheus , ou les r\u00e8gles de Traveller , il n'a besoin de cr\u00e9diter personne, car ces r\u00e8gles ne sont pas soumises au copyright. Evidemment, dans le cadre d'utilisation de la trademark \"Cepheus\" (qui n'existe pas mais supposons qu'elle existe), marque qui n'appartient pas au tiers, alors ce dernier doit avoir une licence. Ici, l'utilisation de la pseudo-marque Cepheus implique d'inclure des mentions. La CSL de Flynn est donc une licence d'usage de trademark (mais pas du contenu de type r\u00e8gles). Dommage que les marques ne soient pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, car cela rend cette licence invalide. \u00a75. Selling a full version of this game with your house rules incorporated into it is perfectly permissible, but you may not sell an effectively unchanged copy of the rules for money. De mani\u00e8re stricte, cet article veut emp\u00eacher \u00e0 quelqu'un de revendre quelque chose de gratuit (le Cepheus SRD in extenso ) sans modification. Il aurait sans doute fallu trouver une autre fa\u00e7on de le pr\u00e9senter. A noter que c'est ce que WotC a reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 Casus Belli lors de l'affaire de H\u00e9ros & Dragons : d'avoir publi\u00e9 un jeu qui reprenait de mani\u00e8re trop litt\u00e9rale le SRD 5.1. Pour autant, si un tiers copie toutes les r\u00e8gles in extenso de Cepheus , sans modification, et les revend sous un autre nom, personne ne peut l'attaquer. Le seul angle d'attaque serait qu'il y ait dans le Cepheus SRD, des contenus soumis au copyright (hors r\u00e8gles). \u00a76. If your document is a private house rules document, not being sold for profit or general use, you may scan and use artwork (including the cover) from the printed version, published in print under the title of Cepheus Engine Core Rules, provided that the cover contains the words \u201cHouse Rules,\u201d near the title, and that the artists are appropriately credited. Ce point est plus compliqu\u00e9 que ce que l'auteur pense. En effet, les illustrations sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de leur auteur. Jason Kemp tente de contraindre la personne qui veut faire un jeu d\u00e9riv\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle ne le vend pas (notion floue de \"private house rules document\"). Il indique que le nouvel auteur peut r\u00e9utiliser les illustrations en cr\u00e9ditant leur auteur. Pour que cela soit suffisant (le nouvel auteur respecte la CSL et c'est suffisant), il faudrait que les illustrations appartiennent \u00e0 Flynn. En effet, si les illustrations ne lui appartiennent pas, sa licence CSL ne peut pas se substituer \u00e0 la licence des images originales. Il aurait pu tourner les choses autrement, par exemple : Les images du Cepheus SRD sont soumises \u00e0 licence (voir page X du SRD pour la liste des cr\u00e9dits d'images). Si vous souhaitez les r\u00e9utiliser, veillez \u00e0 respecter les licences originales de ces images. Mais, dans ce cas, il n'aurait fait que rappeler la loi US sur le copyright (voir le cas de C dans notre exemple ci-dessus). En lieu et place, il introduit une ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 en faisant croire que le respect du \u00a76 de la licence CSL suffit \u00e0 \u00eatre conforme au droit, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Toute utilisation de contenu d\u00e9riv\u00e9 (hors r\u00e8gles) par un tiers doit \u00eatre fait dans le cadre d'une licence non-exclusive ou d'un transfert de droits (voir plus haut). \u00a77. Your rights under this CSL cannot be revoked, and are perpetual, unless you breach the terms of the license, in which case your rights terminate. Cette clause me met toujours mal \u00e0 l'aise. Le contenu appartient \u00e0 quelqu'un et ce dernier peut revendre les droits \u00e0 tout moment ; il peut mourir et donc c\u00e9der ses droits \u00e0 ses descendants ; etc.. Tout possesseur de droits peut mettre fin \u00e0 des licences existantes. Donc, cette clause n'est pas une garantie. La question reste le contenu, et potentiellement la dur\u00e9e du copyright avant que le contenu ne passe dans le domaine public (libre pour toujours dans ce cas). \u00a78. If you comply with the above, you may state that your resource is \u201cfor use with the Cepheus Engine Core Rules\u201d, \u201ccompatible with the core rules of Cepheus Engine\u201d or \u201cwith the Cepheus Engine Core Rules.\u201d Nous sommes bien sur une question de protection de trademark. Le gros probl\u00e8me de Cepheus est que la marque n'est pas enregistr\u00e9e (en classe 28) au niveau des marques US. Ainsi, la revendication de la filiation d'une trademark est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s dangereuse. En effet, tout tiers peut d\u00e9poser Cepheus en classe 28 quand il le souhaite et demander \u00e0 Jason Kemp de retirer tous ses produits de la vente pour infraction \u00e0 la loi sur les trademarks. Pour \u00e9conomiser 350$, certains auteurs de JDR prennent des risques bien grands. Conclusion # Il est urgent que le monde du JDR m\u00fbrisse sur ces sujets. Aujourd'hui, tout est monnayable et la nom compr\u00e9hension des lois sur le copyright et les trademarks peut vite devenir probl\u00e9matique pour certains acteurs du march\u00e9. 07 avril 2024","title":"Les licences \"ouvertes\" dans le JDR"},{"location":"pages/licences/#le-droit-americain-sur-le-copyright","text":"La loi am\u00e9ricaine sur le copyright est un document d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 Title 17 , disponible en ligne et assorti d'une jurisprudence assez importante.

Dans la loi am\u00e9ricaine, un copyright est un ensemble de droits sur une \u0153uvre, cela depuis 1978. Chaque droit peut faire l'objet de transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou d'une licence exclusive ou non-exclusive : La licence exclusive s'apparente \u00e0 un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur un ou plusieurs droits (mais pas tous) ; La licence non-exclusive s'apparente \u00e0 une autorisation d'usage sous certaines conditions et pour une certaine dur\u00e9e. A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d. La notion d'\"\u0153uvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e\" est bien entendu au c\u0153ur de la notion de jeux fond\u00e9s sur des SRD et sur les licences qui les accompagnent. \u201cLiterary works\u201d are works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied. Bien entendu les JDR sont des \u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires, mais un peu particuli\u00e8res, comme nous allons le voir en raison des diff\u00e9rents types de contenus qui les composent. Nous trouvons aussi la d\u00e9finition d'une licence dans le Compendium et le Glossaire : License: An agreement by which a party grants another party one or more rights (but fewer than all rights), usually limited to a particular territory and/or time period. A license may be granted as an exclusive license or a nonexclusive license. Dans le cadre des trois mod\u00e8les de licences que nous allons \u00e9tudier (copyright, OGL et ORC), nous parlons de licences non-exclusives. On trouve la d\u00e9finition d'une licence non-exclusive dans le glossaire. Nonexclusive license: A nonexclusive license is \u201ca license of intellectual property rights that gives the licensee a right to use, make, or sell the licensed item on a shared basis with the licensor and possibly other licensees.\u201d BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1 004 (9th ed. 2009). Traduction : une licence non-exclusive est \"une licence de droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle qui donne au r\u00e9cipiendaire le droit d'usage, de cr\u00e9er ou de vendre l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment sous licence sur une base partag\u00e9e avec le propri\u00e9taire des droits et possiblement d'autres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la licence\". Cette d\u00e9finition ne s'applique pas totalement \u00e0 notre cas dans la mesure o\u00f9 les licences dont nous parlons permettent de ne pas payer de royalties au propri\u00e9taire du contenu. Pour autant, dans la suite du document, nous parlerons uniquement de licences non-exclusives.","title":"Quelques d\u00e9finitions"},{"location":"pages/licences/#definition-du-copyright-paragraphe-102","text":"\u00a7 102 \u00b7 Subject matter of copyright: In general (a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.

(N'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 ouvrir l'image dans un nouvel onglet pour une meilleure d\u00e9finition.) Nous voyons sur ce sch\u00e9ma les deux niveaux de gestion des droits sur le contenu. Pour faire plus simple, nous utiliserons le mot \"extension\" pour qualifier tout ce qui peut \u00eatre copie compl\u00e8te ou partielle et modification de tout genre. Pour ce qui est des r\u00e8gles, quelques que soient leurs extensions, ces derni\u00e8res ne sont pas soumises au copyright. Elles peuvent donc \u00eatres \u00e9tendues. Cela est vrai \u00e0 tous les niveaux. Constatons qu'au niveau de C, nous avons potentiellement quatre types de r\u00e8gles (en bleu), toutes non soumises au copyright (dans le cas o\u00f9 C est dans une g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie de contenus allant de A vers B vers C). Cela veut aussi dire qu' il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'attribuer la paternit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles \u00e0 qui que ce soit \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elles n'appartiennent \u00e0 personne . Ce point est tr\u00e8s important, comme nous le verrons ensuite. Pour ce qui est du contenu sous copyright cr\u00e9\u00e9 par A, ce dernier ne peut pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 sans une licence explicite de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 entre A et B. Cette licence ne peut pas \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9rique, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle doit pr\u00e9ciser les termes de l'usage. Par exemple, si je veux publier un sc\u00e9nario pour Forgotten Realms , il me faut faire un accord explicite avec WotC, une licence non-exclusive, dans l'esprit de la d\u00e9finition de la licence de la loi sur le copyright : [...] a right to use, make, or sell the licensed item on a shared basis with the licensor [...] Evidemment, les sujets des royalties, du respect de l'esprit de l'\u0153uvre originale et potentiellement de la qualit\u00e9 de l'\u0153uvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e seront au c\u0153ur des n\u00e9gociations. Cela vaut pour toutes les situations de ce type et le sch\u00e9ma montre une licence explicite entre B et C sur une extension par C du contenu sp\u00e9cifique cr\u00e9\u00e9 par B et pour lequel B poss\u00e8de le copyright. Le seul cas non trivial de cette situation est le cas en rouge sur le diagramme. Supposons que B ait une licence avec A pour faire une extension de son contenu sous copyright. C peut \u00e9tendre \u00e0 nouveau ce contenu s'il poss\u00e8de deux licences : Une de la part de A sur l'extension du contenu original cr\u00e9\u00e9 par A, Une de la part de B sur l'extension de la contribution de B. Car, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le contenu sous copyright est et reste, dans le cadre des licences non-exclusives, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du possesseur du copyright original.","title":"Vision synth\u00e9tique, cas des licences non-exclusives"},{"location":"pages/licences/#cas-des-licences-exclusives","text":"La licence exclusive proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un ou plusieurs droits (mais pas de tous), pour une dur\u00e9e et des conditions donn\u00e9es. Si je poss\u00e8de un personnage de BD par exemple, je peux transf\u00e9rer le droit d'adaptation \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cin\u00e9matographique de mani\u00e8re exclusive, moyennant accord financier, conditions et dur\u00e9e.

Ces licences sont exclusives (c'est un transfert exclusif du droit de cr\u00e9er un JDR dans l'univers de Tolkien), elles ont une dur\u00e9e de vie, des conditions et un arrangement financier. Cette situation semble, dans le monde du JDR, limit\u00e9e aux adaptations d'\u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires, cin\u00e9matographiques ou t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelles comme Star Gate RPG, Dune RPG, Indiana Jones RPG, Men in Black RPG, Star Wars RPG, etc.","title":"Cas des licences exclusives"},{"location":"pages/licences/#seconde-conclusion-sur-la-loi-sur-le-copyright","text":"Selon la loi sur le copyright, il est donc parfaitement possible d'utiliser les r\u00e8gles de n'importe quel jeu : Sans licence, Sans cr\u00e9diter l'auteur original, Pour faire des \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es commerciales.

Ces m\u00e9caniques de jeu sont, en effet, tr\u00e8s li\u00e9es avec le background du jeu.

Pour le SRD 5.1 de D&D , les choses sont plus simples : en enlevant quelques noms propres, les sorts deviennent de pures m\u00e9caniques non li\u00e9es \u00e0 des univers et sortent donc du domaine du copyright. La preuve en est que les m\u00e9caniques psioniques de Dark Sun ne font pas partie du SRD, alors que ce sont des r\u00e8gles, mais faisant partie int\u00e9grante de l'univers Dark Sun soumis au copyright. Notons quand m\u00eame, dans le SRD 5.1 de D&D , une partie introductive d\u00e9crivant explicitement ce qui est Product Identity (les trademarks, les noms propres et quelques contenus sp\u00e9cifiques).

Le possesseur de la licence peut dicter ses lois sur le contenu qu'il partage - mais il doit respecter aussi la loi sur le copyright. \u00a71.

(b)\"Derivative Material\" means copyrighted material including derivative works and translations (including into other computer languages), potation, modification, correction, addition, extension, upgrade, improvement, compilation, abridgment or other form in which an existing work may be recast, transformed or adapted; Cette notion de Derivative Material est presque mot pour mot la d\u00e9finition de Derivative Work pr\u00e9sent dans la loi US sur le copyright.

C'est la premi\u00e8re partie du contenu du document soumis \u00e0 cette licence. to the extent such content does not embody the Product Identity Le Product Identity est, selon WotC, la partie soumise au copyright. C'est la deuxi\u00e8me partie du contenu du texte dont il question. and is an enhancement over the prior art Cette phase est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9trange et cela sur deux points. Tout d'abord, WotC semble vouloir dire que de nouvelles r\u00e8gles port\u00e9es par la personne exer\u00e7ant la licence doit \u00eatre une am\u00e9lioration de ce qui existe. C'est un v\u0153u pieu, mais tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 prouver. Par exemple, le Black Hack est-il une am\u00e9lioration des r\u00e8gles ou une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration ? Le second point est que cela n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec le fait d'\u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d' Open Game Content (OGC) . Par rapport \u00e0 la loi, toute r\u00e8gle de jeu est OGC, qu'elle soit une am\u00e9lioration ou pas. and any additional content clearly identified as Open Game Content by the Contributor, Il s'agit l\u00e0 de la troisi\u00e8me partie du contenu : un contenu soumis au copyright mais que le titulaire de la licence aurait envie de d\u00e9clarer OGC. Notons que nous entrons ici un peu dans la confusion. Nous parlions jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, WotC, qui d\u00e9finissait une licence pour que des personnes ou des compagnies aient l'usage de son contenu (A dans le sch\u00e9mas ci-dessus). Nous sommes maintenant \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 nous parlons des d\u00e9clarations des possesseurs de licences (B dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus). C'est le probl\u00e8me de vouloir faire une licence g\u00e9n\u00e9rique. Au titre de la loi am\u00e9ricaine, le contenu soumis au copyright reste soumis au copyright. Comme ce contenu a une certaine valeur, son possesseur devrait d\u00e9finir la licence avec ceux qui en auront l'usage. Cette licence doit avoir une dur\u00e9e, des conditions et un arrangement financier. Bien entendu, rien n'oblige le possesseur de ce copyright \u00e0 utiliser la licence OGL pour licencier son contenu. and means any work covered by this License, including translations and derivative works under copyright law, but specifically excludes Product Identity. Cette phrase est tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange. De fait, les \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es selon la loi du copyright ne sont pas OGC (les traductions ne sont pas OGC de l'avis m\u00eame de la licence OGL, voir ci-dessus). Il est possible que WotC ait voulu parler des traductions et des autres \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es soumises au copyright que les auteurs auraient voulu mettre en OGC quand m\u00eame (alors qu'elles ne le sont pas par d\u00e9faut). Mais la formulation est totalement obscure si c'est cette interpr\u00e9tation qu'il faut retenir. Mais voyons donc la fameuse notion de Product Identity . (e) \"Product Identity\" means product and product line names, logos and identifying marks including trade dress; Nous parlons ici de trademarks . artifacts; creatures characters; stories, storylines, plots, thematic elements, dialogue, incidents, language, artwork, symbols, designs, depictions, likenesses, formats, poses, concepts, themes and graphic, photographic and other visual or audio representations; names and descriptions of characters, spells, enchantments, Malheureusement, les sorts sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des r\u00e8gles du jeu. Le cas des sorts associ\u00e9s \u00e0 des noms propres est plus ambigu, car nous sommes entre le Product Identity et l'OGC, donc d\u00e9fendable en tant que Product Identity dans la mesure o\u00f9 la r\u00e8gle est partie int\u00e9grante de l'univers (cf. remarques ci-dessus \u00e0 propos de Dark Sun ). personalities, teams, personas, likenesses and special abilities; places, locations, environments, creatures, equipment, magical or supernatural abilities or effects, logos, symbols, or graphic designs; Cette liste est assez \u00e9trange car contraire avec le contenu ouvert par WotC dans le SRD 5.1 de D&D . En ouvrant les sorts dans le SRD 5.1, WotC est en contradiction avec la licence appos\u00e9e sur le SRD ! On verra plus loin, avec l'affaire du SRD V2.0, qu'en plus de 20 ans, la compr\u00e9hension du droit du copyright semble toujours obscure chez certaines personnes de WotC. and any other trademark or registered trademark clearly identified as Product identity by the owner of the Product Identity, and which specifically excludes the Open Game Content; Encore les trademarks. (f) \"Trademark\" means the logos, names, mark, sign, motto, designs that are used by a Contributor to identify itself or its products or the associated products contributed to the Open Game License by the Contributor De nouveau les trademarks. (g) \"Use\", \"Used\" or \"Using\" means to use, Distribute, copy, edit, format, modify, translate and otherwise create Derivative Material of Open Game Content. M\u00eame d\u00e9finition que Derivative Work de la loi US. (h) \"You\" or \"Your\" means the licensee in terms of this agreement. \u00a72. The License: This License applies to any Open Game Content that contains a notice indicating that the Open Game Content may only be Used under and in terms of this License. You must affix such a notice to any Open Game Content that you Use. No terms may be added to or subtracted from this License except as described by the License itself. No other terms or conditions may be applied to any Open Game Content distributed using this License. \u00a73. Offer and Acceptance: By Using the Open Game Content You indicate Your acceptance of the terms of this License. \u00a74. Grant and Consideration: In consideration for agreeing to use this License, the Contributors grant You a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license with the exact terms of this License to Use, the Open Game Content. Droit d'usage du contenu OGC. La formulation employ\u00e9e, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license , est \u00e9trangement emprunt\u00e9e au cas de l'administration am\u00e9ricaine d\u00e9crit dans le cadre de la loi US sur le copyright. En effet, dans le paragraphe 105 de ladite loi, il est stipul\u00e9 qu'un employ\u00e9 de l'Etat appartenant \u00e0 certaines organisations conserve son copyright mais qu'on peut lui ordonner de donner \u00e0 l'Etat une irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, nonexclusive license to reproduce, distribute, perform, or display . Le probl\u00e8me est que WotC n'est pas l'Etat, que la licence est un contrat entre deux parties et que si une des deux parties meurt ou le souhaite, la licence s'arr\u00eate, ce qui n'est pas le cas de l'Etat am\u00e9ricain. \u00a75.Representation of Authority to Contribute: If You are contributing original material as Open Game Content, You represent that Your Contributions are Your original creation and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. Encore une formulation absconse : que doit-on entendre par \"mat\u00e9riau original\" ( original material ) ? Si ce mat\u00e9riau est compos\u00e9 de r\u00e8gles, alors aucun copyright ne peut \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9 ; sinon, ce mat\u00e9riau est sous copyright. Dans le premier cas, il n'y a pas besoin de repr\u00e9sentation ; dans le second, le possesseur du copyright devrait poser une notice copyright comme demand\u00e9 par le droit am\u00e9ricain. De plus, rien n'indique que le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence OGL voudra utiliser la m\u00eame licence quand il voudra licencier son travail d\u00e9riv\u00e9, celui sur lequel il poss\u00e8de le copyright. Notons qu'il est dangereux de pr\u00e9sumer que l'on donne gratuitement un copyright sans licence, car utiliser la licence OGL sur un contenu copyright\u00e9 que l'on poss\u00e8de et que l'on souhaite ouvrir est tr\u00e8s dangereux pour le possesseur - et le droit am\u00e9ricain nous le dit. Supposons que je cr\u00e9e dans le cadre d'une licence OGL D&D Mister DarkFuzz, un h\u00e9ros aux caract\u00e9ristiques sp\u00e9ciales et que je l'int\u00e8gre dans ma d\u00e9claration OCG en tant que copyright que je transforme en OGC. Supposons que quelqu'un produise une campagne \u00e0 succ\u00e8s, des livres et un film sur Mister DarkFuzz. Quels sont mes moyens de contr\u00f4ler mon copyright ? \u00a76.Notice of License Copyright: You must update the COPYRIGHT NOTICE portion of this License to include the exact text of the COPYRIGHT NOTICE of any Open Game Content You are copying, modifying or distributing, and You must add the title, the copyright date, and the copyright holder's name to the COPYRIGHT NOTICE of any original Open Game Content you Distribute. Evidemment, r\u00e9utiliser du contenu non soumis \u00e0 copyright (OGC) ne n\u00e9cessite pas de cr\u00e9diter ni WotC, ni Gygax, ni qui que ce soit. Car, les r\u00e8gles de D&D , dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles sont g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, ne peuvent pas porter de copyright. On dirait que cet article est l\u00e0 pour dire \u00e0 Hasbro, la maison m\u00e8re de WotC : regardez, vous avez achet\u00e9 de l'IP ( Intellectual Property ) ! Mais le fait est que non. Au regard du droit US sur le copyright, tout le SRD \u00e9tait ouvert avant m\u00eame qu'il ne soit publi\u00e9. Il n'est donc pas besoin de cr\u00e9diter quelqu'un pour un mat\u00e9riau qui est dans le domaine public. J'entends des m\u00e2choires qui grincent, mais c'est bien la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. \u00a77. Use of Product Identity: You agree not to Use any Product Identity, including as an indication as to compatibility, except as expressly licensed in another, independent Agreement with the owner of each element of that Product Identity. WotC rejoint le droit am\u00e9ricain (voir les licences explicites dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus). On ne peut pas licencier du contenu sous copyright sans quelques pr\u00e9cautions. You agree not to indicate compatibility or co-adaptability with any Trademark or Registered Trademark in conjunction with a work containing Open Game Content except as expressly licensed in another, independent Agreement with the owner of such Trademark or Registered Trademark. La cons\u00e9quence de cette phrase est de statuer la compatibilit\u00e9 avec D&D par une phrase du genre \"compatible avec le plus grand JDR du monde\". The use of any Product Identity in Open Game Content does not constitute a challenge to the ownership of that Product Identity. The owner of any Product Identity used in Open Game Content shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to that Product Identity. Amusant : cette remarque est totalement conforme avec le droit am\u00e9ricain. Tout possesseur de copyright garde ses droits m\u00eame s'il a permis \u00e0 des tiers d'utiliser un ou plusieurs droits non exclusifs de mani\u00e8re non payante. Ainsi, oui, WotC a raison, accorder l'usage gratuit d'un contenu sous copyright d\u00e9clar\u00e9 comme OGC ne remet pas en cause la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du copyright, et n'est pas un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (cas des licences non-exclusives). \u00a78. Identification: If you distribute Open Game Content You must clearly indicate which portions of the work that you are distributing are Open Game Content. Voil\u00e0 quelque chose de contraignant et j'avoue ne l'avoir jamais vraiment vu faire. Les gens pr\u00e9cisent, au contraire, ce qui est Product Identity. Les reste est OGC. \u00a79. Updating the License: Wizards or its designated Agents may publish updated versions of this License. You may use any authorized version of this License to copy, modify and distribute any Open Game Content originally distributed under any version of this License. Soit en bon fran\u00e7ais : \u00a79. Mise \u00e0 jour de la licence : Wizards ou ses repr\u00e9sentants d\u00e9sign\u00e9s peuvent publier des mises \u00e0 jour de cette licence. Vous pouvez utiliser n'importe quelle version autoris\u00e9e de cette licence pour copier, modifier et distribuer n'importe quel contenu Open Game Content originellement distribu\u00e9 sous n'importe quelle version de cette licence. Cet article indique que WotC peut d\u00e9cider que la version V1.0a est non autoris\u00e9e et autoriser une V2 qui elle demande 50% des revenus faits par le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence. C'est en un sens ce qu'ils ont fait avec la tentative de licence V2.0. Beaucoup de gens ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cet article comme un risque juridique important. Au final, ce n'en est pas un du tout en raison du type de contenus publi\u00e9 par WotC (voir plus bas). \u00a710. Copy of this License: You MUST include a copy of this License with every copy of the Open Game Content You Distribute. Nous remettons en cause ce besoin au regard de la loi sur le copyright (voir plus loin) en raison du type de contenu distribu\u00e9 par WotC \u00e0 l'origine : si le premier contenu n'a pas de copyright, il n'est pas besoin de cascader la licence. \u00a711. Use of Contributor Credits: You may not market or advertise the Open Game Content using the name of any Contributor unless You have written permission from the Contributor to do so. Encore une fois le sujet des trademarks. Oui, personne ne doit user des trademarks de WotC sans accord. Mais c'est vrai de toutes les trademarks. \u00a712. Inability to Comply: If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Open Game Content due to statute, judicial order, or governmental regulation then You may not Use any Open Game Material so affected. \u00a713. Termination: This License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with all terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses shall survive the termination of this License. La derni\u00e8re affirmation est p\u00e9remptoire mais rien ne le prouve. Si WotC dispara\u00eet et se fait racheter par une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la licence peut \u00eatre termin\u00e9e. Mais, au final, est-ce si grave ? Non (voir ci-dessous). \u00a714. Reformation: If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. \u00a715.

END OF LICENSE","title":"Examen de la licence"},{"location":"pages/licences/#une-pierre-deux-coups-et-beaucoup-de-confusion","text":"La licence OGL V1.0a (OGL) tente de r\u00e9soudre deux probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 la fois : Cr\u00e9er une licence g\u00e9n\u00e9rique entre WotC et ses r\u00e9cipiendaires ; Cr\u00e9er une licence applicable entre ses r\u00e9cipiendaires et les gens \u00e0 qui ils voudraient accorder le m\u00eame droit. La licence OGL est donc \"double\". Elle est aussi contaminante \"implicitement\". Les trois types de contenu d'un document, selon WotC, sont : l'OGC : des r\u00e8gles soumises \u00e0 la licence OGL ; le Product Identity : exclus de la licence et copyright r\u00e9serv\u00e9 de celui qui utilise la licence ; le Product Identity d\u00e9clar\u00e9 OGL par le possesseur du copyright. Or selon la loi sur le copyright et selon la d\u00e9finition m\u00eame de WotC, le contenu OGC est non soumis au copyright . Donc pas besoin de licence pour l'exploiter. Et pas besoin non plus de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 son auteur. Donc pas besoin de licence OGL . Selon la loi sur le copyright, ce que WotC d\u00e9finit comme Product Identity (en excluant monstres g\u00e9n\u00e9riques et sorts g\u00e9n\u00e9riques) est soumis \u00e0 la loi sur le copyright, tout comme les trademarks. Il n'est donc pas possible de les utiliser sans accord explicite et gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 avec WotC. La licence OGL n'apporte rien non plus sur cette cat\u00e9gorie de contenu qui est, de facto , prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le droit am\u00e9ricain. Evidemment, la licence OGL peut jouer le r\u00f4le de \"rappel de la loi\" aupr\u00e8s de ceux qui, ne comprenant pas bien les limites des contenus prot\u00e9g\u00e9s et non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, auraient envie d'utiliser le contenu des univers D&D ou les marques pour leur produit d\u00e9riv\u00e9. Elle marque en quelque sorte la limite explicite entre les types de contenus. Il reste la troisi\u00e8me sorte de contenu : le Product Identity d\u00e9clar\u00e9 OGL par le possesseur du copyright dans le but de le transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 des r\u00e9cipiendaires au travers d'une licence (laquelle ?). La loi am\u00e9ricaine est simple sur le sujet : le copyright reste \u00e0 son ayant droit et la licence doit \u00eatre d\u00e9finie (exclusive avec transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ou non-exclusive). Celui qui veut licencier son propre contenu (par exemple B \u00e0 C dans le diagramme ci-dessus) choisira alors son mode licensing, ses conditions et sa dur\u00e9e.","title":"Une pierre, deux coups et beaucoup de confusion"},{"location":"pages/licences/#intention-et-realite","text":"L'ironie de l'affaire est que WotC, dans son SRD 3.5, ne publie en 2000 que du contenu OGC. Donc ils ne font que publier ce qui, chez eux, n'est pas soumis au copyright ! Et donc que tout le monde a le droit de le copier sans autre forme de proc\u00e8s ! Ils n'ont pas besoin de licence pour \u00e7a, mais cette derni\u00e8re va faire peur... et va, en m\u00eame temps, dynamiser le march\u00e9. A l'examen, il semble donc bien que cette licence OGL soit une grosse arnaque . Beaucoup de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s vont s'encha\u00eener \u00e0 l'OGL alors que ne pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rencer l'OGL et prendre le contenu du SRD sans cr\u00e9diter WotC est parfaitement l\u00e9gal, selon les propres termes de la licence elle-m\u00eame, et surtout selon la d\u00e9finition du copyright US. Je pense qu'\u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 90, apr\u00e8s le rachat de TSR, WotC a compris que les r\u00e8gles n'\u00e9taient ni copyright-ables, ni patent-ables. Ils se sont dit qu'il ne fallait pas que le monde du JDR s'en aper\u00e7oive. Ils ont trouv\u00e9 ce coup de pub \u00e9norme, inspir\u00e9 du software open source, coup de pub qui est, de fait, une gigantesque arnaque. Et tout le monde est tomb\u00e9 dans le panneau ! Et moi le premier en d\u00e9couvrant toute l'histoire vingt ans apr\u00e8s la bataille. Mais apr\u00e8s analyse, ce coup de bluff est un baudruche. Et comme le milieu du JDR est un petit monde avec peu de juristes, la pilule est pass\u00e9e, notamment celle de contaminer les contenus \"descendants\", soit entre le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la \"licence\" de WotC et le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence du r\u00e9cipiendaire de la \"licence\" de WotC (entre B et C). Car si le contenu de WotC OGC est compos\u00e9 de r\u00e8gles sur lesquelles aucun copyright n'est possible, il n'existe aucun devoir \u00e0 une personne physique ou morale qui voudrait utiliser les r\u00e8gles de D&D pour \u00e9tendre ces r\u00e8gles, ainsi qu'aucune obligation d'attribution. Au travers de cette licence, WotC a, de plus, menac\u00e9 toute la communaut\u00e9 : En r\u00e9affirmant qu'on ne pouvait pas pirater impun\u00e9ment ses marques et ses univers (le fameux Product Identity), ce qui est totalement vrai et compatible avec le droit am\u00e9ricain sur le copyright ; En levant toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 et en publiant le contenu OGC ouvert, fa\u00e7on de tracer la limite entre leur Product Identity et ce sur quoi aucun copyright ne portait. C'est malin, quoique la licence soit mal \u00e9crite, bien plus mal que le droit US lui-m\u00eame.","title":"Intention et r\u00e9alit\u00e9"},{"location":"pages/licences/#utilisation-de-la-licence-cc-by-40-pour-le-srd-51-de-dd-arnaque-phase-2","text":"La licence Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 est une licence non-exclusive qui n'\u00e9tablit aucun transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.

D'ailleurs, il serait sans doute bien de regarder de plus pr\u00e8s les licences GNU et leur conformit\u00e9 au droit US.","title":"Utilisation de la licence CC-BY-4.0 pour le SRD 5.1 de D&amp;D : arnaque phase 2 ?"},{"location":"pages/licences/#analyse-de-la-licence-cc4-dans-le-cadre-du-srd-du-dd","text":"La licence CC4 porte la m\u00eame dualit\u00e9 que la licence OGL : selon les moments elle parle de celui qui poss\u00e8de le copyright et qui autorise l'usage de son contenu sans royalties (A dans le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus) ; \u00e0 d'autres moments, elle parle de celui qui exploite le contenu et qui a envie de l'utilisation de son contenu dans la cha\u00eene \"descendante\" des acteurs (B et C dans le sch\u00e9ma). Dans la page de garde de la licence , on nous explique : You are free to: Share \u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially . Adapt \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially . The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms. Le dernier point me semble trop simpliste car, comme la licence est bas\u00e9e sur le copyright, si le \"licensor\" change, alors le copyright change et donc les droits d'exploitation peuvent \u00eatre remis en question. Regardons ce qui est \u00e9crit dans la licence . Notre analyse portera uniquement sur l'application de cette licence au monde des JDR (et plus particuli\u00e8rement au SRD). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions [...] L'aspect contractuel de la licence est expliqu\u00e9 en pr\u00e9ambule. Dans les d\u00e9finitions, on voit de suite que la licence CC-BY-4.0 (CC4 pour faire plus court) n'est pas pens\u00e9e pour le sujet du jeu de r\u00f4le, soit pour une \u0153uvre \u00e9tant un m\u00e9lange de contenus \"litt\u00e9raires\" dont (au regard de la loi am\u00e9ricaine) une partie poss\u00e8de des droits et est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le copyright (les personnages nomm\u00e9s, les histoires, les lieux, etc.) et une partie ne l'est pas (les r\u00e8gles du jeu). La licence CC4 ne propose que deux concepts concernant les contenus : Licensed Material : le contenu qui est ouvert, sur lequel celui qui poss\u00e8de les droits les partage \u00e0 l'autres ; Adapted Material : ce que les autres font avec ce contenu. La licence repousse le probl\u00e8me des deux types de contenus du Adapted Material , ceux sous copyright et ceux sans, \u00e0 la licence que va employer l'utilisateur des contenus sous CC4. 1.b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. Comme dans le droit am\u00e9ricain, celui qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un contenu d\u00e9riv\u00e9 poss\u00e8de un copyright sur ses contributions seulement (pas sur le contenu original bien s\u00fbr). 2.a.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Cet article montre les droits donn\u00e9s par cette licence. Il est possible de faire ce que l'on souhaite avec le contenu original dans le monde entier et sans payer de royalties si tant est que l'on respecte les conditions d' attribution de la licence, soit que l'on nomme le cr\u00e9ateur original. 2.a.5. paragraph 2. No downstream restrictions . You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. En effet, au regard du droit US sur le copyright, il n'est pas possible d'imposer des contraintes diff\u00e9rentes ou suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la licence du contenu original ( Licensed Material ). La question est : est-ce que ce contenu est CC4 et donc doit rester CC4 dans toutes les it\u00e9rations, notamment dans les liens entre un B et un C au titre du sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus. 2.b.3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. \"To the extend possible\" veut dire \"dans la mesure du possible\", ce qui n'est pas tr\u00e8s rassurant. Mais la deuxi\u00e8me partie de l'article pr\u00e9cise que les r\u00e9serves concernant le fait que celui qui ouvre son contenu veuille des royalties doivent \u00eatre explicites. J'avoue que cet article me laisse un peu perplexe. Si quelqu'un peut prouver devant un tribunal que, parce que sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait menac\u00e9e de faillite, alors il a chang\u00e9 son mode de licensing pour collecter des droits, nous serions dans l'incertitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e par cette condition \"dans la mesure du possible\". Nous arrivons l\u00e0 au c\u0153ur du probl\u00e8me. On lit dans la partie Attribution les conditions de l'exploitation de la licence : 3.a.1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i.identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; La notice du copyright est \u00e9videmment la notice du copyright du propri\u00e9taire du contenu original. Ce fait est tr\u00e8s important : la licence CC4 donne le droit d'exploitation du contenu mais ne change pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce dernier. Cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 reste soumise au copyright. Or, pour les jeux de r\u00f4les, la jurisprudence am\u00e9ricaine consid\u00e8re que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne s'applique qu'\u00e0 une partie du contenu original : la partie non relative aux r\u00e8gles du jeu. Demander un copyright sur le contenu devient donc, dans le cadre des jeux, une mention ambigu\u00eb : les r\u00e8gles D20 ne sont pas sous copyright alors que le terme D20 est une trademark et les Forgotten Realms le sont. Dans le cadre d'un SRD ne publiant que des r\u00e8gles, nous avons vu ci-dessus qu'il \u00e9tait inutile de rappeler que les r\u00e8gles du SRD \u00e9taient copyright WotC alors que des r\u00e8gles ne peuvent pas porter de copyright. Il est \u00e9galement inutile de cr\u00e9diter les auteurs. iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. Voil\u00e0 ce que demande WotC dans le SRD 5.1 de D&D en version CC4 en terme de cr\u00e9dits : The System Reference Document 5.1 is provided to you free of charge under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (\u201cCC-BY-4.0\u201d). You are free to use this content in any manner permitted by that license as long as you include the following attribution statement in your own work: This work includes material taken from the System Reference Document 5.1 (\u201cSRD 5.1\u201d) by Wizards of the Coast LLC and available at https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document. The SRD 5.1 is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode. Il est tr\u00e8s amusant que WotC ne demande pas de citer son copyright . Pourquoi ? Parce que ces derniers savent que le contenu du SRD n'est pas soumis au copyright ! Il utilisent donc la fa\u00e7on courante CC4 d'attribuer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \"by WotC\" qui n'a aucune valeur juridique et qui maintient l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. Voir ici : Sometimes, the author will also provide a copyright notice, which consists of the copyright symbol, year of publication, and the name of the author/licensor. Include the copyright notice as a part of your attribution if such information is provided. Comme WotC impose des choses sur son contenu, ils auraient d\u00fb imposer de cr\u00e9diter leur copyright. Or ils ne le font pas, tout simplement parce qu'ils n'en ont pas sur cette partie. Cela signifie qu'ils savent que le point de vue d\u00e9fendu par cet article est vrai mais que, tant que les choses marchent, ils continuent \u00e0 faire illusion ! Please do not include any other attribution regarding Wizards other than that provided above. You may, however, include a statement on your work that it is \u201ccompatible with fifth edition\u201d or \u201c5E compatible.\u201d Section 5 of CC-BY-4.0 includes a Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability that limits our liability to you. Notons que, dans cette version, WotC ouvre sa simili-trademark \"5e\" ou \"Fifth Edition\", cela facilite l'identification des produits, ce qui est une bonne chose. Mais l\u00e0 encore, WotC enfonce une porte ouverte : \"5e\" ou \"Fifth edition\" ne peut pas faire l'objet d'une vraie trademark en raison de son caract\u00e8re vraiment trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rique. Seul Googman Games avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une trademark sur Fifth Edition Fantasy mais l'a abandonn\u00e9 en juin 2023. Mais revenons \u00e0 la licence CC4. 3.a.3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. Cet article pr\u00e9cise que le cr\u00e9ateur du contenu original a quand m\u00eame des droits sur ce contenu, au point de pouvoir modifier la mention. Dans la mention demand\u00e9e par WotC, mention sans copyright original, on peut assumer que WotC a implicitement utilis\u00e9 cet article pour ne pas indiquer que le contenu du SRD \u00e9tait soumis au copyright. 3.a.4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Pour la troisi\u00e8me fois, la licence indique que le contenu original est toujours sous la licence CC4 et que ce contenu doit rester sous la licence CC4. Nous dirons que nous sommes dans une \"contamination partielle\" port\u00e9e par la licence. Nous avons vu que la licence CC4 est li\u00e9e au copyright original, ce qui est normal. Cela a pour implication : Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. Voil\u00e0 la cons\u00e9quence naturelle : si les droits se terminent, la licence CC4 devient caduque et il n'est plus possible d'exploiter le contenu. Le copyright est un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par une entit\u00e9 qui a sa dur\u00e9e de vie. Comme toute licence, le possesseur du copyright peut la terminer s'il le souhaite.","title":"Analyse de la licence CC4 dans le cadre du SRD du D&amp;D"},{"location":"pages/licences/#cc4-ou-ogl-meme-combat","text":"En fait, nous en sommes au m\u00eame point. D\u00e8s lors que le contenu distribu\u00e9 par WotC n'est pas soumis au copyright, ces derniers peuvent bien le distribuer sous toutes les licences du monde. Il y a un gros c\u00f4t\u00e9 hypocrite dans le fait de distribuer ce contenu sous une licence CC4, car la licence CC4 indique que le contenu \"ouvert\" doit \u00eatre distribu\u00e9 sous licence CC4. Or c'est faux dans notre cas au titre du fait que le contenu est non soumis au copyright. Il est donc compl\u00e8tement libre. Or comme la licence CC4 impose une attribution des auteurs, elle impose une contrainte suppl\u00e9mentaire par rapport \u00e0 la nature du contenu. Elle est donc en violation avec le droit US : elle restreint l'usage d'un contenu totalement libre en obligeant \u00e0 une attribution. Notons que c'est aussi le cas de l'OGL ! Cette \"licence\" restreint l'utilisation d'un contenu public en obligeant \u00e0 cr\u00e9diter des personnes qui, au regard de la loi US, ne portent aucun copyright sur le contenu. Il est notable que WotC nous prouve, avec les mentions port\u00e9es dans le document SRD 5.1 CC4 et l'absence d'usage de son copyright dans la demande d'attribution, qu'il est au courant de l'affaire.

La licence commence par une page d'introduction red\u00e9finissant les contenus dans le SRD 5.1 de D&D . Certaines parties du SRD ne seraient pas publi\u00e9s sous la licence CC4 : Les classes de personnages, Les sorts, pi\u00e8ges, maladies, folie, objets, poisons, et objets magiques, Les conditions des personnages. Pourquoi faire ces choix ? Myst\u00e8re. Surtout qu'apr\u00e8s avoir ouvert ce contenu pendant si longtemps (depuis 2016 ), il est facile de montrer que beaucoup de ces chapitres sont des r\u00e8gles et des m\u00e9caniques de jeu - donc qu'aucun copyright ne s'applique dessus. Sur ce qui reste du SRD, WotC propose de mettre une licence CC4 . Sur les parties non soumises \u00e0 la licence CC4 (voir liste ci-dessus), ce serait la licence OGL V1.2 qui s'appliquerait. Ce distinguo indique qu'en 2023, WotC d\u00e9finit les nouveaux contours d'un \"mini SRD\" reprenant toutes les r\u00e8gles auxquelles incontestablement, il est impossible d'attacher un copyright (les parties sous CC4). Si ce mini-SRD \u00e9tait cr\u00e9\u00e9, il serait possible de b\u00e2tir des jeux \u00e9ternellement libres sur cette base.

Le p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de la licence est beaucoup moins vague qu'auparavant : WotC s'adresse aux cr\u00e9ateurs de JDR. \u00a71. LICENSED CONTENT (a) Content Covered (i) Our Licensed Content. This license covers any content in the SRD 5.1 (or any subsequent version of the SRD we release under this license) that is not licensed to you under Creative Commons. You may use that content in your own works on the terms of this license. Le contenu sorti de la licence CC4 est le Licenced Content. (ii) Our Unlicensed Content. Only Our Licensed Content is licensed under this license. Any other content we release or have released is not licensed to you under this license. Nouvelle notion : unlicensed content , tous les autres contenus sans licence ne sont, \u00e9videmment, pas utilisables. (iii) Your Content. This is your creative contributions to your works that are not Our Licensed Content or Our Unlicensed Content. This license permits you to combine Your Content with Our Licensed Content and distribute the resulting works as authorized by this license. On aurait pu dire Derived Works comme dans le droit am\u00e9ricain sur le copyright. (b) Works Covered. This license only applies to printed media and static electronic files (such as epubs or pdfs) you create for use in or as tabletop roleplaying games and supplements (\u201cTTRPGs\u201d) and in virtual tabletops in accordance with our Virtual Tabletop Policy (\u201cVTTs\u201d). (c) Your Licensed Works. To be a Licensed Work under this license, it must: (i) be a covered work as defined in Section 1(b); (ii) contain both Our Licensed Content and Your Content; and (iii) not contain Our Unlicensed Content. Cette d\u00e9finition est redondante avec ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit avant. (d) Copyrights. We are only licensing you our copyrights in Our Licensed Content, except that under Section 5(a) we also grant you a trademark license to the Creator Product badge, as further detailed in the Creator Product Badge Style Guide. You receive no other rights to our trademarks, and no rights to any other intellectual property we own. En termes de contenus, nous allons voir les restrictions. En termes de forme, WotC voulait imposer une forme sp\u00e9ciale aux suppl\u00e9ments des cr\u00e9ateurs, comme ce que l'on peut trouver sur D&D Beyond ou DMs Guild. Cette contrainte est totalement inacceptable pour des \u00e9diteurs de jeux tierces qui ont toujours eu leur propre visuel et leur propre gestion artistique. De plus, cette contrainte artistique est bien adapt\u00e9e pour les petits sc\u00e9narios publi\u00e9s sur les plateformes en ligne telles D&D Beyond ou DMs Guild, mais pas pour les nouveaux jeux. Il \u00e9tait normal que cette nouvelle version provoque un toll\u00e9. \u00a72. LICENSE. In consideration for your compliance with this license, you may copy, use, modify and distribute Our Licensed Content around the world as part of Your Licensed Works. This license is perpetual (meaning that it has no set end date), non-exclusive (meaning that we may offer others a license to Our Licensed Content or Our Unlicensed Content under any conditions we choose), and irrevocable (meaning that content licensed under this license can never be withdrawn from the license). It also cannot be modified except for the attribution provisions of Section 5 and Section 9(a) regarding notices. Cette garantie est fausse. Dans le droit am\u00e9ricain, une licence d'utilisation peut s'arr\u00eater. Le sujet est : est-ce que cette licence porte que des contenus sous copyright ? D'ailleurs, WotC aurait pu aller plus loin et rendre invendable les produits sous licence OGL V1.0a. \u00a73. WHAT YOU OWN. Your Licensed Works are yours. They may not be copied or used without your permission. Excellent ! WotC donne des le\u00e7ons de copyright aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la licence ! On aura tout vu. You acknowledge that we and our licensees, as content creators ourselves, might independently come up with content similar to something you create. If you have a claim that we breached this provision, or that one of our licensees did in connection with content they licensed from us: (a) Any such claim will be brought only as a lawsuit for breach of contract, and only for money damages. You expressly agree that money damages are an adequate remedy for such a breach, and that you will not seek or be entitled to injunctive relief. C'est incroyable ! WotC demande aux r\u00e9cipiendaires des licences de s'engager sur les types de recours qu'ils pourraient faire dans des cas de soup\u00e7ons de plagiat de la part de WotC ou d'un autre r\u00e9cipiendaire... Cette mention est parfaitement contraire au droit du copyright qui autorise toutes sortes de recours en cas de plagiat. En d'autres termes WotC demande aux r\u00e9cipiendaires de la licence de s'engager \u00e0 ne pas avoir recours \u00e0 tous les moyens juridiques \u00e0 leur disposition. N'importe quoi. (b) In any such lawsuit, you must show that we knowingly and intentionally copied your Licensed Work. Access and substantial similarity will not be enough to prove a breach of this Section 3. Ils ne manquent pas d'air et veulent faire le proc\u00e8s et ses conclusions dans la licence. Hasbro et WotC sont-ils au courant qu'ils sont dans un \u00e9tat souverain avec des lois auxquelles ils sont soumis ? \u00a74. WHAT WE OWN. We own Our Licensed Content and reserve all rights not expressly granted in this license. N-i\u00e8me redite de la m\u00eame chose. \u00a75. YOU CONTROL YOUR CONTENT. You can make your Content available under any terms you choose C'est une nouveaut\u00e9 bienvenue en comparaison des sous-entendus de la version 1.0a. Oui, dans le cadre de la loi sur le copyright, il est possible de faire les licences et les transferts de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que le possesseur de la licence souhaite. but you may not change the terms under which we make Our Licensed Content available. Le contenu original de WotC reste en licence OGL V1.2. (a) You must clearly indicate that your Licensed Work contains Our Licensed Content under this license either by including the full text of this license in your Licensed Work or by applying the Creator Products badge in compliance with the then-current style guidelines. Clairement, WotC demandait des choses inacceptables quant au style impos\u00e9 sur les \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es. Il serait int\u00e9ressant de consulter un sp\u00e9cialiste du droit du copyright pour savoir s'il est possible de donner l'usage d'un contenu tout en contraignant la forme. De ce que j'ai lu, je ne me souviens pas d'avoir vu ce genre de contraintes (\u00e0 part la mise en place d'un logo par exemple). Il n'est pas certain que cette clause de forme soit d\u00e9fendable en proc\u00e8s et ne soit pas, pour des produits aussi artistiques que les livres de JDR d'aujourd'hui, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme inacceptable et remettant en cause le Product Identity du r\u00e9cipiendaire de la licence. (b) You may permit the use of your Content on any terms you want. However, if any license you offer to your Licensed Work is different from the terms of this license, you must include in the Licensed Work the attribution for Our Licensed Content found in the preamble to the applicable SRD, and make clear that Our Licensed Content included in your Licensed Work is made available on the terms of this license. Cette demande est l\u00e9gitime et conforme au droit du copyright et des \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es. \u00a76. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS. You represent and warrant that: (a) Age and Capacity to Be Bound. You are over the age of majority or, if younger, have had your parent or guardian review these terms and agree to them on your behalf. Etrange remarque dans un contrat. (b) Authority. You have the power and authority to enter into this license and perform its obligations. (c) No Infringement. Your Licensed Works do not and will not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights or any of our rights not licensed to you via this license or any other. WotC tente de se prot\u00e9ger, mais en faisant signer des d\u00e9clarations vagues. (d) No Endorsement. Except as otherwise expressly allowed by this license, you will not state, suggest, or imply that Your Licensed Works are endorsed by or associated with us. Mention classique. (e) No Illegal Conduct. You will not violate the law in any way relating to this license or Your Licensed Works. Cette mention a au moins le m\u00e9rite de la na\u00efvet\u00e9. (f) No Hateful Content or Conduct. You will not include content in Your Licensed Works that is harmful, discriminatory, illegal, obscene, or harassing, or engage in conduct that is harmful, discriminatory, illegal, obscene, or harassing. We have the sole right to decide what conduct or content is hateful, and you covenant that you will not contest any such determination via any suit or other legal action. Cette contrainte, encore une fois, est inacceptable. Il n'appartient pas \u00e0 WotC \u00e0 juger du respect de la loi. Cette partie 6 a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 absurde. Dans la partie Warranty g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui licencie son contenu doit se prot\u00e9ger en disant que tout ce qui peut arriver n'est pas de sa faute, en gros que tout ce qui peut se faire de mal avec son contenu n'est plus de sa responsabilit\u00e9. En lieu et place, WotC fait signer un contrat d'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 une plateforme de type r\u00e9seau social en obligeant les r\u00e9cipiendaires de licences \u00e0 accepter des r\u00e8gles dont ils doivent rendre compte devant WotC. C'est une confusion des genres. \u00a77 MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION (a) Modification. We may only modify the provisions of this license identifying the attribution required under Section 5 and the notice provision of Section 9(a). We may not modify any other provision. Cette d\u00e9claration n'a aucune valeur. (b) Termination (i) We may immediately terminate your license if you infringe any of our intellectual property; bring an action challenging our ownership of Our Licensed Content, trademarks, or patents; violate any law in relation to your activities under this license; or violate Section 6(f). Oui comme dans un r\u00e9seau social. (ii) We may terminate your license if you breach any other term in this license, and do not cure that breach within 30 days of notice to you of the breach. \u00a78. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE LICENSED CONTENT \u201cAS IS\u201d AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND CONCERNING YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED CONTENT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. YOU BEAR ALL RISK OF USING THE LICENSED CONTENT AND SUCH USE IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK. We have no liability to you for any types of damages in connection with your use of Our Licensed Content including without limitation any indirect, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, so long as our conduct at issue was not grossly negligent or intentional. Voil\u00e0 la fameuse mention que nous mentionnions auparavant. Elle est totalement suffisante dans une licence en lieu et place de la section 6. \u00a79.MISCELLANEOUS (a) Notices. We may notify you by any email or physical address we can locate for you. Only if we cannot locate your email or physical address after a reasonable search, notice via a public channel is sufficient. You may provide notice to us of your email or physical address, or any other notice, by emailing oglnotices@wizards.com. (b) Entire Agreement and Disclaimer of Reliance. This license governs your use of Our Licensed Content. This license consists only of the terms expressly included herein, and not any matter not expressly included herein. In accepting this license, you represent and warrant to us that you have relied only on the terms of the license and the advice of your own counsel, if any; you have not relied on anything that is not expressly a part of this license. Verbiage pseudo-juridique redondant avec de multiples endroits dans cette licence. (c) No Waiver of Rights. If we fail to exercise any right we have under this license, that failure will not prevent us from exercising that right in the future. Cela ne veut rien dire. (d) Severability. If any part of this license is held to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, Wizards may declare the entire license void, either as between it and the party that obtained the ruling or in its entirety. Unless Wizards elects to do so, the balance of this license will be enforced as if that part which is unenforceable or invalid did not exist. On sent que les personnes qui ont \u00e9crit cette licence n'ont pas confiance en eux. (e) Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Class Action Waiver. This license and all matters relating to its interpretation and enforcement will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and any disputes arising out of or relating to this license will be resolved solely and exclusively through individual litigation in the state or federal courts located in the county in which Wizards (or any successor) has its headquarters, and the parties expressly consent to the jurisdiction of such courts. Each party hereto irrevocably waives the right to participate in any class, collective, or other joint action with respect to such a dispute. N'importe quoi. Encore une fois, WotC ne peut pas faire signer \u00e0 quelqu'un qu'il s'engage \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 ses droits l\u00e9gaux en cas de litige. C'est absurde. Il s'agit probablement d'une clause copi\u00e9e et coll\u00e9e d'un contrat commercial entre deux entreprises, clause totalement hors sujet dans le cadre de cette licence. (f) Headings and Footnotes. The headings and footnotes contained in this license are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this license. Mention inutile. (g) Waiver of Jury Trial. We and you each waive any right to a jury trial of any dispute, claim or cause of action related to or arising out of this license. M\u00eame remarque qu'auparavant. Il est impossible de renoncer \u00e0 ses droits l\u00e9gaux dans le cadre d'une licence. (h) Review by Counsel. You should seek advice of counsel to make sure you understand this license. You agree that you had the opportunity to do so. Mention parfaitement stupide.","title":"La version 1.2"},{"location":"pages/licences/#confusion-a-tous-les-etages","text":"Osons le dire, ce draft for discussion purposes est un torchon ! Il faut absolument que WotC fasse appel \u00e0 des gens comp\u00e9tents en droit du copyright, car ce \"truc\" est la preuve d'une incomp\u00e9tence juridique crasse. Une fois de plus, WotC \u00e9tait en pleine confusion, voire en plein d\u00e9lire : Confusion de logique : Quel lien entre le contenu prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l'OGL V2.0 et la licence elle-m\u00eame ? Quel lien entre le contenu CC4 et le contenu lui-m\u00eame ? Il n'y a aucune logique. Pourquoi ce d\u00e9coupage ? Certains monstres ont une origine tr\u00e8s ancienne dans D&D , alors pourquoi ne figurent-ils pas dans les \u00e9l\u00e9ments non CC4 de la licence ? Confusion de compr\u00e9hension de la nature des contenus Vouloir prot\u00e9ger un contenu qu'on a ouvert pendant tr\u00e8s longtemps signifie que l'on a mesur\u00e9 le risque juridique de se faire attaquer sur ce point car, pendant des ann\u00e9es (au moins entre 2016 et 2023 soit pendant 7 ans), les gens ont pris l'habitude d'utiliser ce contenu gratuitement. Il y a eu la mise en place d'un usage r\u00e9gulier . Le risque juridique aurait donc \u00e9t\u00e9 que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s attaquent WotC pour d\u00e9montrer que les contenus nouvellement \"ferm\u00e9s\" par la licence OGL V2.0 \u00e9taient en fait des r\u00e8gles du jeu sur lesquelles aucun copyright ne pouvait \u00eatre pos\u00e9. Comme illustration, regardons n'importe quelle classe de personnages, contenu nouvellement ferm\u00e9 dans la licence OGL V2.0, et osons dire que ce n'est pas une r\u00e8gle. Confusion business : WotC a-t-il r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'une oeuvre d\u00e9riv\u00e9e doit pouvoir s'exprimer par la forme et donc qu'une contrainte sur la forme est inacceptable ? Une licence d'utilisation d'un contenu ne peut pas \u00eatre contrainte \u00e0 une forme, mais \u00e9ventuellement le respect d'un esprit (dans le cadre de licences exclusives). Si trop de contraintes sont ajout\u00e9es, la licence devient un contrat de prestation pour le compte de WotC, mais ce n'est plus un contrat de licence. Cela pose le probl\u00e8me des contrats sign\u00e9s par les utilisateurs des plateformes comme DMS Guild qui imposent une forme sp\u00e9ciale. Depuis ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, D&D Beyond s'est mis \u00e0 publier du contenu de tierces parties sans imposer ces contraintes. Confusions l\u00e9gales : Il n'est pas possible dans le cadre d'une licence de faire signer aux r\u00e9cipiendaires des renonciations \u00e0 leurs droits l\u00e9gaux, ni de contraindre \u00e0 pr\u00e9-choisir des modes d'attaques ou de d\u00e9fense en cas de proc\u00e8s. Il n'est pas possible de d\u00e9terminer par avance l'issue de potentielles attaques, par exemple dans le cas d'un plagiat. Ces litiges doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9solus par les tribunaux dans l'exercice plein et entier du droit am\u00e9ricain. Confusion de textes l\u00e9gaux : on trouve dans cette licences des \u00e9l\u00e9ments venant de multiples sources : Des licences de type CC4, Des conditions d'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 un service Internet en ligne (type D&D Beyond), Des clauses qui ressemblent \u00e0 celles d'un contrat de travail, Des clauses contractuelles \u00e9tablies dans le cadre d'un accord entre deux compagnies. Ce document est une honte pour le monde du JDR tant l'incomp\u00e9tence des gens ayant travaill\u00e9 sur ce dossier est patente. De plus, au regard de son caract\u00e8re propre \u00e0 tuer le business, il est normal que la licence OGL V2.0 ait suscit\u00e9 l'ire des compagnies exploitant la licence OGL v1.0a.","title":"Confusion \u00e0 tous les \u00e9tages"},{"location":"pages/licences/#conclusion-de-laffaire","text":"Devant la lev\u00e9e de boucliers, WotC se d\u00e9cide \u00e0 publier le SRD 5.1 dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 en version OGL V1.0a et en version CC-BY-4.0 (CC4).

Et portant, 2023 nous montre que : Les comp\u00e9tences juridiques ne sont pas au rendez-vous, car personne de comp\u00e9tent n'a pu dignement drafter cette licence ; WotC semble avoir une peur panique des proc\u00e8s, alors que tout le monde a peur, dans le cadre de l'OGL, d'enfreindre des copyrights et de se faire attaquer par WotC, ce qui est un peu ironique ; WotC n'a aucune strat\u00e9gie claire concernant l'OGL ou les liens avec les compagnies utilisant cette licence (m\u00eame si en 2024, des \u00e9diteurs tiers commencent \u00e0 mettre leur produits compatibles 5e sur D&D Beyond) ; Certaines personnes de WotC doivent savoir que le contenu SRD 5.1 est sans doute non soumis au copyright dans sa quasi-totalit\u00e9, tandis que d'autres aimeraient croire et faire croire le contraire. WotC est une belle machine pour sortir des livres physiques et des PDF, pour exploiter aussi des contenus en ligne, mais le reste montre de gros manques en termes de strat\u00e9gie et de comp\u00e9tences.","title":"Peur des proc\u00e8s"},{"location":"pages/licences/#suite-des-evenements-dans-le-monde-ogl-en-janvier-2023","text":"La communaut\u00e9 OGL a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de panique quand des informations ont fait part de la volont\u00e9 de WotC de r\u00e9voquer la licence OGL V1.0a.","title":"Suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements dans le monde OGL en janvier 2023"},{"location":"pages/licences/#la-licence-orc-et-ses-differences-avec-logl-v10a","text":"Certaines entreprises de jeux contestant la licence OGL dans le monde du JdR, Kobold Press, Paizo et Chaosium, entre autres, se sont alli\u00e9es pour cr\u00e9er une autre licence : ORC . La licence d\u00e9finit essentiellement les contours entre trois types de contenus : Le contenu sur lequel il n'est pas possible de mettre un copyright (pour faire simple toutes les r\u00e8gles) ; Le contenu prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ( Reserved Material ) qu'il n'est pas possible de copier sans l'autorisation des auteurs ; Le contenu \"ouvert\" ( Licensed Material ) dont il est possible de d\u00e9river des choses. Par d\u00e9faut : Tout ce qui est r\u00e8gles du jeu (au sens large) est public ; Tout ce qui est li\u00e9 \u00e0 des lieux, des personnages, etc. est \"priv\u00e9\" ; il faut donc sp\u00e9cifier ce que la licence couvre pour \"ouvrir un contenu prot\u00e9g\u00e9\". On revient aux fondamentaux de la loi sur le copyright. La notice ORC est assez bien structur\u00e9e car elle distingue bien tous les types de contenus : Le texte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que du Congr\u00e8s am\u00e9ricain et, en cela, est suppos\u00e9 durer (tr\u00e8s) longtemps sans \u00eatre alt\u00e9r\u00e9. Il est poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par Azora Law , un cabinet d'avocats de Seattle, suppos\u00e9 garder une certaine neutralit\u00e9 dans le sujet des licences. Il est possible de faire un petit tableau comparatif entre OGL et ORC : Type de contenu OGL V1.0a ORC V1.0 R\u00e8gles du jeu Open Game Content Licensed Material Contenu non ouvert Product Identity Reserved Material Contenu ouvert Open Game Content Expressly Designated Licensed Material R\u00e9f\u00e9rence de filiation Amendement de la Copyright notice (article 15) Notice compl\u00e8te \u00e0 4 sections Texte de la licence Poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par WotC Poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par Azora Law P\u00e9rennit\u00e9 de la licence Article 9 **non p\u00e9renne** Article V. b. \"**p\u00e9renne**\" Sur les trois premiers param\u00e8tres, les deux licences sont tr\u00e8s proches. En ce qui concerne la filiation, la licence ORC est plus pr\u00e9cise. En ce qui concerne le risque juridique que WotC remette en cause la licence OGL, tout est li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 9 (voir analyse un peu plus haut dans la page). Encore une fois, plusieurs points sont \u00e0 noter. La licence ORC entend clairement s'attaquer \u00e0 l'article 9 de la licence OGL V1.0a, le fameux article qui indique que WotC peut changer sa licence, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9 avec la version 2.0. La volont\u00e9 est clairement de rendre \"\u00e9ternelle\" cette ouverture de contenu : V.b. Modifications. This ORC License may not be amended, superseded, modified, updated, repealed, revoked, or deauthorized. Neither You nor Licensor may modify the terms of this ORC License; however, You may enter into a separate agreement of Your own making provided such agreement does not seek to modify the terms hereof. This ORC License does not, and shall not be interpreted to reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this ORC License. On comprend bien l'intention. Pour autant, cette intention est un v\u0153u pieu par rapport au droit US. Nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9 mais le d\u00e9tenteur d'un copyright poss\u00e8de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce copyright. Quand il d\u00e9finit une licence non exclusive, cette derni\u00e8re n'est valide que dans certaines conditions, conditions qui peuvent changer. Il n'est donc pas plus possible de garantir la p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 de la licence avec ORC qu'avec CC4.Nous ne parlons bien entendu pas de la p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 du texte de la licence, mais des objets qui sont couverts par elle. La particularit\u00e9 de ce dossier est que le contenu lui-m\u00eame ne peut pas \u00eatre soumis au copyright donc nous parlons pour rien. Bien entendu, peu de gens ont int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 lever l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du copyright li\u00e9 aux r\u00e8gles. Au contraire, beaucoup de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 se prot\u00e9ger derri\u00e8re des licences m\u00eame si ces derni\u00e8res sont bancales ou juste inapplicables. Au niveau de leurs investisseurs, cela peut rassurer.","title":"La licence ORC et ses diff\u00e9rences avec l'OGL V1.0a"},{"location":"pages/licences/#mais-pourquoi-reinventer-une-cc4","text":"C'est un peu la question qu'on peut l\u00e9gitimement se poser, surtout apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t par WotC de tout le SRD 5.1 en CC4. Car, au final, si l'article 9 de la licence OGL V1.0a est vis\u00e9, autant prendre une licence qui existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 et qui n'est pas poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par WotC. Certes, la licence ORC est plus pr\u00e9cise en distinguant bien les trois types de contenus, mais est-ce si important ? Car la vraie question derri\u00e8re toute cette histoire est quand m\u00eame : est-il important qu'une licence soit poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par celui qui l'utilise pour ouvrir son contenu ? Parce que, si nous revenons aux fondamentaux, regardons ce que font les ayant-droits de Tolkien avec leurs licences exclusives JDR : Ils signent des accords du dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e avec des entreprises de jeu ; Ils doivent sans doute mettre des crit\u00e8res sur les produits d\u00e9riv\u00e9s, notamment le respect de l'\u0153uvre, du monde, etc. ; Ils n\u00e9gocient des royalties ; Il est probable que la licence poss\u00e8de des conditions de sortie pr\u00e9matur\u00e9es pour le cas o\u00f9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des licences s'av\u00e8re incomp\u00e9tente ou en faillite par exemple. Certes, WotC ne publie pas ses contenus Product Identity en publiant un SRD en CC4, mais il est quand m\u00eame normal que cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 elle veut le faire, que ce soit pour de bonnes ou de mauvaises raisons, d\u00e9crive les termes qui l'arrangent dans la mesure o\u00f9 il se peut qu'elle croie honn\u00eatement (ce dont je doute mais supposons) qu'elle permette \u00e0 l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me de profiter de son IP ( Intellectual Property ) gratuitement. Dans la d\u00e9marche, l'utilisation en cascade de la licence OGL est un peu \u00e9trange, car un certain nombre de termes de cette licence ne sont pas adapt\u00e9s aux \u0153uvres d\u00e9riv\u00e9es, mais il n'est pas choquant que, si on suppose que WotC cro\u00eet partager son copyright, ces derniers s'arrogent le droit (qu'ils ont du fait de la loi sur le copyright !) de changer la licence voire de la rendre obsol\u00e8te (cf. article 9). Pour ce qui est des autres compagnies, que cherchent-elles vraiment ? Si elles cherchent \u00e0 construire sur un socle fiable dans le temps, ces derni\u00e8res risqueront toujours de suivre WotC qui, en raison de ses marques et de son aura, et aussi d'une bonne qualit\u00e9 de ses produits, reconnaissons-le, aura toujours une version d'avance. Pour ceux qui ont mis\u00e9 sur le D20 voil\u00e0 20 ans et sur le SRD 3.5, ils peuvent continuer de tenter de vendre des produits, car c'est possible. Ce n'est jute plus vendable... ...Plus vendable hormis pour Paizo qui, avec Pathfinder 2e, a fait le choix de rester dans la lign\u00e9e du SRD 3.5 avec une nouvelle branche qui enl\u00e8ve toute mention ambigu\u00eb pouvant les taxer d'atteinte au copyright de WotC. C'est finalement peut-\u00eatre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 la plus sens\u00e9e dans cette histoire car elle a vis\u00e9 le fond du probl\u00e8me : r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer toutes les r\u00e8gles qu'elle voulait, car ces r\u00e8gles \u00e9taient du domaine public, et changer les d\u00e9nominations pour \u00e9viter toute exposition \u00e0 un potentiel risque de Product Identity. Elle peut donc maintenant travailler sans d\u00e9pendance par rapport \u00e0 WotC. Pour autant, les r\u00e8gles de Pathfinder 2e, elles-aussi, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre soumises au copyright ! Mais les autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, que veulent-elles \u00e0 part vouloir vendre des produits 5e avec le contenu du SRD 5.1 ouvert, pas de royalties et pas de risque juridique ? Regardons le sujet de plus pr\u00e8s.","title":"Mais pourquoi r\u00e9inventer une CC4 ?"},{"location":"pages/licences/#ouverture-de-brp-5e-en-orc","text":"D\u00e9but 2024, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Chaosium a publi\u00e9 quasiment toute la 5e du Basic RolePlaying (BRP) system en ORC. Il est donc possible de voir cette publication comme, une fois de plus, une ligne trac\u00e9e entre ce qui est du contenu sans copyright d'un contenu avec copyright. Au moins, les choses sont clairement exprim\u00e9es et \u00e9crites. Le SRD l\u00e8ve donc l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du m\u00e9lange des contenus et s'aligne, en cela, comme nous ne cessons de le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, avec la loi US sur le copyright. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, c'est le lot des syst\u00e8mes de jeu g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ( BRP , GURPS , D&D , etc.) d'avoir une tr\u00e8s grosse partie de leur contenu publiable en mode SRD - sans copyright. Je sais que c'est le cauchemar de Steve Jackson de GURPS mais un jour, la baudruche se d\u00e9gonflera... Faute de mieux et histoire de demander \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 d'\u00eatre fair play avec les inventeurs, citer la filiation est un acte de bonne conduite que les licences OGL, CC-BY-V4.0 et ORC veulent rendre obligatoire. Mais si l'acte est moralement bon, il ne figure pas dans les obligations l\u00e9gales de la loi sur le copyright. Chaosium n'est pas en concurrence avec WotC, on pourrait m\u00eame que ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont eu des int\u00e9r\u00eats communs du temps de Call of Cthulhu D20. Pour Chaosium qui veut, je pense, continuer de jouer sur cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles sans copyright et du mat\u00e9riel prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par ledit copyright, c'est une fa\u00e7on de tenter de faire comme WotC, de faire fructifier un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me qui, au final, fait de la publicit\u00e9 pour un syst\u00e8me de jeu et dynamise les ventes. Que la licence soit ORC ou CC4 n'a que peu d'importance. Il \u00e9tait tellement tentant de surfer sur la vague d'indignation caus\u00e9e par l'OGL V2.0.

If you use our Licensed Material in your own published works, please credit us as follows: Black Flag Roleplaying Reference Document v0.1, \u00a9 Open Design, LLC d/b/a Kobold Press Kobold Press remplit les exigences de la licence ORC sur la demande \u00e0 ses \"descendants\" de faire une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur le contenu original. Notons que ces derniers ont appos\u00e9 leur copyright sur le r\u00e9sultat ! Quel toupet, alors que le copyright ne porte que sur les innovations de Kobold Press... Alors, en tant que cr\u00e9ateur de jeu, j'inclue leur mention dans mon jeu mais avec ou sans la mention du SRD de D&D ? Nous sommes typiquement dans le cas de C si l'on regarde le sch\u00e9ma ci-dessus. Alors, refaisons encore une fois le parcours : Si le contenu du SRD 5.1 et le contenu de Kobold Press sont soumis au copyright, alors la licence est valide et je dois avoir une licence pour les deux, CC4 pour le SRD 5.1 et Orc pour le contenu Kobold Press. Car bien entendu, Kobold Press n'a pas le droit de changer la licence CC4 du SRD 5.1 par une distribution sous licence ORC. Il faut donc les deux licences. Si le contenu n'est que compos\u00e9 de r\u00e8gles, ce que je pense \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, alors je peux tout copier et en faire ce que je veux sans citer personne. Compliqu\u00e9, n'est-il pas ? Reserved Material: Reserved Material elements in this product include all elements designated as Reserved Material under the ORC License. Expressly Designated Licensed Material: This product contains no Expressly Designated Licensed Material. Consid\u00e9rant que le document Black Flag ne contient aucune mention explicite \u00e0 du Reserved Material , tout ce qui n'est pas m\u00e9canique de jeu (au sens de la licence ORC) peut donc \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 du contenu sous copyright. La derni\u00e8re phrase ent\u00e9rine ce fait en insistant sur le fait qu'il n'y a pas, en dehors du contenu r\u00e8gles et assimil\u00e9, de contenu sous copyright explicitement ouvert. Une lecture rapide de Black Flag permet de voir que le contenu est une version simplifi\u00e9e du SRD 5.1 de D&D plus quelques innovations de r\u00e8gles (la r\u00e8gle \"Doom\" par exemple). Il faut un peu de toupet pour apposer un copyright \u00e0 ce jeu qui ne s'appuie sur aucune trademark ! Black Flag doit servir de fondation au jeu Tales of the Valiant . Par cette manipulation de licences, Kobold Press veut construire sur une base ouverte inattaquable et inalt\u00e9rable lui permettant d'exploiter le contenu de WotC. Il veut aussi \"donner\" cela \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9. C'est une approche \"ceinture et bretelles\" mais qui maintient l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 sur la nature du contenu du SRD 5.1. En prenant uniquement un extrait de ce contenu, les Kobold Press entendent d\u00e9finir \u00e0 leur tour ce qui n'est vraiment pas, de mani\u00e8re certaine, soumis au copyright. Faire cela revient un peu \u00e0 faire la m\u00eame chose que ce qu'a fait Paizo pour Pathfinder 2e, au risque de s'accrocher \u00e0 une version de D&D qui va vieillir rapidement.

De mani\u00e8re stricte, cet article veut emp\u00eacher \u00e0 quelqu'un de revendre quelque chose de gratuit (le Cepheus SRD in extenso ) sans modification. Il aurait sans doute fallu trouver une autre fa\u00e7on de le pr\u00e9senter. A noter que c'est ce que WotC a reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 Casus Belli lors de l'affaire de H\u00e9ros & Dragons : d'avoir publi\u00e9 un jeu qui reprenait de mani\u00e8re trop litt\u00e9rale le SRD 5.1. Pour autant, si un tiers copie toutes les r\u00e8gles in extenso de Cepheus , sans modification, et les revend sous un autre nom, personne ne peut l'attaquer. Le seul angle d'attaque serait qu'il y ait dans le Cepheus SRD, des contenus soumis au copyright (hors r\u00e8gles). \u00a76. If your document is a private house rules document, not being sold for profit or general use, you may scan and use artwork (including the cover) from the printed version, published in print under the title of Cepheus Engine Core Rules, provided that the cover contains the words \u201cHouse Rules,\u201d near the title, and that the artists are appropriately credited. Ce point est plus compliqu\u00e9 que ce que l'auteur pense. En effet, les illustrations sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de leur auteur. Jason Kemp tente de contraindre la personne qui veut faire un jeu d\u00e9riv\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle ne le vend pas (notion floue de \"private house rules document\"). Il indique que le nouvel auteur peut r\u00e9utiliser les illustrations en cr\u00e9ditant leur auteur. Pour que cela soit suffisant (le nouvel auteur respecte la CSL et c'est suffisant), il faudrait que les illustrations appartiennent \u00e0 Flynn. En effet, si les illustrations ne lui appartiennent pas, sa licence CSL ne peut pas se substituer \u00e0 la licence des images originales. Il aurait pu tourner les choses autrement, par exemple : Les images du Cepheus SRD sont soumises \u00e0 licence (voir page X du SRD pour la liste des cr\u00e9dits d'images). Si vous souhaitez les r\u00e9utiliser, veillez \u00e0 respecter les licences originales de ces images. Mais, dans ce cas, il n'aurait fait que rappeler la loi US sur le copyright (voir le cas de C dans notre exemple ci-dessus). En lieu et place, il introduit une ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 en faisant croire que le respect du \u00a76 de la licence CSL suffit \u00e0 \u00eatre conforme au droit, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Toute utilisation de contenu d\u00e9riv\u00e9 (hors r\u00e8gles) par un tiers doit \u00eatre fait dans le cadre d'une licence non-exclusive ou d'un transfert de droits (voir plus haut). \u00a77. Your rights under this CSL cannot be revoked, and are perpetual, unless you breach the terms of the license, in which case your rights terminate. Cette clause me met toujours mal \u00e0 l'aise. Le contenu appartient \u00e0 quelqu'un et ce dernier peut revendre les droits \u00e0 tout moment ; il peut mourir et donc c\u00e9der ses droits \u00e0 ses descendants ; etc.. Tout possesseur de droits peut mettre fin \u00e0 des licences existantes. Donc, cette clause n'est pas une garantie. La question reste le contenu, et potentiellement la dur\u00e9e du copyright avant que le contenu ne passe dans le domaine public (libre pour toujours dans ce cas). \u00a78. If you comply with the above, you may state that your resource is \u201cfor use with the Cepheus Engine Core Rules\u201d, \u201ccompatible with the core rules of Cepheus Engine\u201d or \u201cwith the Cepheus Engine Core Rules.\u201d Nous sommes bien sur une question de protection de trademark. Le gros probl\u00e8me de Cepheus est que la marque n'est pas enregistr\u00e9e (en classe 28) au niveau des marques US. Ainsi, la revendication de la filiation d'une trademark est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s dangereuse. En effet, tout tiers peut d\u00e9poser Cepheus en classe 28 quand il le souhaite et demander \u00e0 Jason Kemp de retirer tous ses produits de la vente pour infraction \u00e0 la loi sur les trademarks. Pour \u00e9conomiser 350$, certains auteurs de JDR prennent des risques bien grands.","title":"La licence \"CSL\""},{"location":"pages/licences/#conclusion_1","text":"Il est urgent que le monde du JDR m\u00fbrisse sur ces sujets.

Je me suis dit que ce serait une bonne id\u00e9e pour moi de faire la synth\u00e8se de ce que j'ai vu et lu et de ce \u00e0 quoi j'ai jou\u00e9. Attention, tout est tr\u00e8s partial et surtout tr\u00e8s incomplet, mais cela me permet de capitaliser un peu sur ce que je lis. Typologie des syst\u00e8mes # En fait, nous pouvons commencer une typologie des syst\u00e8mes. Le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment est que beaucoup de ces syst\u00e8mes sont le fruit d'une seule personne, ou d'un tr\u00e8s petit groupe de jeu. C'est souvent un inconv\u00e9nient, car travailler sur un groupe large avec une communaut\u00e9 cr\u00e9ative permet de cr\u00e9er des jeux plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9s, plus streamlined comme on dit en anglais. Ensuite, beaucoup de syst\u00e8mes de jeux reprennent les m\u00eames m\u00e9caniques. Un papier assez int\u00e9ressant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit sur les design patterns dans le JDR : Design Patterns of Successful Roleplaying Games . Pour autant, nous pouvons \u00e9tablir une classification un peu diff\u00e9rente des jeux. A compl\u00e9ter. A propos de la liste # La liste est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par ordre alphab\u00e9tique. Elle contiendra de plus en plus les mini-syst\u00e8mes et les liens vers les sites concern\u00e9s. 2D20-System # Jeux Conan Star Trek Adventures Mutant Chronicles 3e Infinity RPG Je connais mal ce syst\u00e8me. J'ai acquis, il n'y a pas longtemps, un exemplaire de Conan 2D20 publi\u00e9 pour le Free RPG Day , mai je n'ai pas eu le temps de regarder. A suivre. 5e, jeux bas\u00e9s sur la 5\u00e8me \u00e9dition de D&D # Jeux bas\u00e9s sur la 5.0/5.5 Adventure in Middle-Earth Tal'Dorei Talislanta Ultramodern 5e Star Wars 5e Alors que dire... Malgr\u00e9 toutes les attaques contre la 5e, on peut voir qu'elle s'adapte plut\u00f4t pas mal \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes choses. J'ajouterai en ligne : Star Wars 5e que je trouve assez r\u00e9ussi. J'aime bien Adventures in Middle-Earth , m\u00eame si je n'ai jamais jou\u00e9. J'ai jou\u00e9, voil\u00e0 bien longtemps, un sc\u00e9nar de MERP (avec un des \"sp\u00e9cialistes\" de Tolkien dans le monde du JDR) mais cela ne m'a pas emball\u00e9. A l'\u00e9poque, des gars avaient la grosse t\u00eate parce qu'ils avaient lu tout Tolkien en anglais. Cela me laissait perplexe. Certes Cubicle 7 a perdu sa licence mais les ayant-droits dudit Tolkien paraissent un peu psychopathes parce qu'on ne b\u00e2tit pas une gamme en 5 minutes. Faut-il que les fans rach\u00e8tent la version Lord of the Rings 5e de Free League ? Quand les gammes changent trop, c'est compliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre. Le pire, ces derniers temps, c'est Pathfinder 2e avec ses deux \u00e9ditions (une OGL et une sans aucune mention venant de l'OGL). Age system # Jeux Fantasy Age Dragon Age Modern Age Je ne connais que les quickstart guides de Dragon Age et de Modern Age , mais le syst\u00e8me est tr\u00e8s voisin : 3D6 + caract\u00e9ristique + focus contre facteur de difficult\u00e9. La table ci-dessous compare les caract\u00e9ristiques de ces jeux avec D&D . Dragon Age Modern Age D&D Accuracy Dexterity Communication Communication Charisma Constitution Constitution Constitution Cunning Intelligence Intelligence Dexterity Dexterity Dexterity Fighting Strength/Dexterity Magic Wisdom/Intelligence/Charisma Perception Perception Wisdom Strength Strength Strength Willpower Willpower Wisdom Pour D&D , nous sommes avec d20 + bonus de caract\u00e9ristique + proficiency bonus + autres bonus contre facteur de difficult\u00e9. Age propose la courbe en cloche des 3D6 contre la lin\u00e9arit\u00e9 du d20. Mouais, why not. Je ne suis pas certain que cela apporte quelque chose. Si, disons que mat\u00e9rialiser Perception comme une caract\u00e9ristique est int\u00e9ressant (c'est un peu une bidouille dans D&D ). Basic Roleplaying System # Jeux Call of Cthulhu Runequest Magic World Stormbringer Elric M-Space Bon, ce syst\u00e8me parfait pour Cthulhu , je pense que c'est clair, m\u00eame si je n'aime pas les caract\u00e9ristiques en pourcentage de la 7\u00e8me \u00e9dition. Pour Runequest , je le trouve un peu dur (voir l' article sur la classe d'armure ) : ainsi, il est facile de mourir suite \u00e0 un mauvais hasard (et non \u00e0 des actions du joueur). Quoiqu'en dise Petersen dans une de ses interviews, cette fa\u00e7on de faire du m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique est un peu dure pour moi. J'avoue : je ne prends pas plaisir \u00e0 tuer des personnages (sauf \u00e0 Cthulhu peut-\u00eatre). En fait, j'ai l'impression que Magic World est plus simple et plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 sans doute que Runequest , m\u00eame si des innovations de Runequest sont tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressantes. Cela me fait l'effet de Stormbringer/Elric qui a pris un parti volontairement tr\u00e8s violent et tr\u00e8s custom sur la partie magie. J'aime beaucoup ce syst\u00e8me m\u00eame si je cherche toujours un syst\u00e8me de psioniques qui vaille le coup : Celui du Big Yellow Book n'est vraiment pas top, On a un embryon de syst\u00e8me dans M-Space mais ce n'est pas top non plus. Cortex Prime # Jeux Battle Star Galatica Smallville Supernatural Bon, l\u00e0, j'avoue que j'ai du mal. Si la m\u00e9canique de base de Cortex Prime est simpliste, d\u00e8s que l'on entre un peu dans les d\u00e9tails, cela me para\u00eet plut\u00f4t compliqu\u00e9. Cela m'a fait un peu le m\u00eame effet que Tri-Stat dX , et j'avoue que je n'ai jamais fait l'effort de rentrer plus dans ces m\u00e9caniques complexes de dice pools et de n\u00e9gociations pour faire le moindre jet. Mais ce doit \u00eatre mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 Microlite20 qui ressort. Cypher # Jeux Numenera The Strange Bon alors l\u00e0, je trouve que ce syst\u00e8me est la preuve qu'un bon cr\u00e9ateur de contenus de JDR comme Monte Cook peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s mauvais concepteur de jeu. Ce n'est d'ailleurs pas \u00e9tonnant : la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 univers/sc\u00e9narios est un talent diff\u00e9rent de celui de cr\u00e9ateur de jeu. Ces jeux font partie des rares que j'ai revendu sans probl\u00e8me. Voir l'article du blog en 2024 . D6 System, OpenD6 # Jeux Ghostbusters WEG Star Wars Indiana Jones Men in Black Metabarons J'ai beaucoup jou\u00e9 et \u00e9crit sur le D6 . J'aime bien ce syst\u00e8me et tout le contenu open qui va avec, m\u00eame si l'\u00e9quilibre du jeu est parfois limite. A noter la partie psionique tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante de D6 Space Opera , un peu moins connu que ses petits camarades (voir ici ). d20 system, jeux bas\u00e9s sur la 3.0/3.5e de D&D # Jeux bas\u00e9s sur la 3.0/3.5 Mutants & Masterminds Microlite20 SotU Talislanta Pathfinder Honte \u00e0 moi : j'ai achet\u00e9 en occasion Mutants & Masterminds 2e voil\u00e0 plus d'un an (je poursuis ma qu\u00eate d'un syst\u00e8me de jeu simple intuitif et explosif pour les pouvoirs psioniques) et je n'ai fait que le feuilleter. C'est sans doute un bon plan que de faire un \"fork\" de la 3e. Microlite est un de mes syst\u00e8mes de jeux favoris Achetez-le ! 1 euro pour 2 700 pages de jeux ! EABA # Je ne connais pas mais il est d\u00e9crit sur Wikipedia . Encore un dice pool system. Fate, Fate Accelerated # Jeux Dresden Files Atomic Robo Diaspora J'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Fudge mais jamais \u00e0 Fate . Je ne suis pas un grand connaisseur mais ce que j'en ai retenu \u00e9tait l'innovation des aspects . Au final, ce jeu m'a paru plut\u00f4t compliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 diriger. FU (Freeform Universal) # Un jeu de r\u00f4le super lite disponible en ligne . Forge Engine # Le PDF est gratuit sur DriveThru donc vous pouvez le t\u00e9l\u00e9charger. Cela sent le syst\u00e8me de jeu fait par un seul homme, comme Cypher . Pour ma part, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu rebut\u00e9 d'embl\u00e9e par le m\u00e9lange de symboles pour les d\u00e9s et de dice pools. Je suis sans doute trop vieux... Fuzion, Interlock # Je note ces syst\u00e8mes pour les analyser plus tard, mais je ne les connais pas. Genesys # Jeux FFG Star Wars Shadow of the Beanstalk Je crois que l'utilisation de d\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciaux m'a tout de suite repouss\u00e9. D\u00e9j\u00e0 avec DCC, si l'on veut vraiment avoir la suite de d\u00e9s, il faut acheter des d\u00e9s tordus mais l\u00e0, cela m'a arr\u00eat\u00e9 tout net. J'y reviendrai peut-\u00eatre. Gumshoe # Jeux Fear Itself Esoterrorists Trail of Cthulhu Night's Black Agents Cthulhu Confidential Swords of the Serpentine Je connais bien Esoterrorists . J'ai acquis une occase de Cthulhu Confidential mais sans avoir pris le temps de le lire (le bouquin est tr\u00e8s gros). Je ne suis pas convaincu par l'hypoth\u00e8se m\u00eame qui a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 ce syst\u00e8me. Il faudrait aussi regarder dans Swords of the Serpentine comment le syst\u00e8me s'adapte \u00e0 du m\u00e9di\u00e9val fantastique. Lien vers le SRD : Gumshoe SRD . GURPS # J'ai en magasin les \u00e9ditions 2, 3 et 4 (enfin compl\u00e8te !) et j'aime bien le syst\u00e8me. Je l'aime particuli\u00e8rement quand il est ultra-simplifi\u00e9 : voir GURPS Ultra-Lite . Les suppl\u00e9ments sont vraiment de grande qualit\u00e9, et tr\u00e8s faciles \u00e0 utiliser pour d'autres jeux, notamment les suppl\u00e9ments (en grand nombre) de la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9dition. Hero System # Jeux Champions Espionage Je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu par le syst\u00e8me H\u00e9ro qui m'a toujours paru tr\u00e8s complexe et quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s adapt\u00e9 au monde des super-h\u00e9ros. Omni System # Jeux Talislanta 4e Atlantis High Medieval Omni System est une variante du syst\u00e8me d20 qui est plus light (pas de classes) mais qui est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s proche (caract\u00e9ristique + comp\u00e9tence + d20 pour faire le plus possible sur une \u00e9chelle de r\u00e9ussite). Pour rigoler, l'image est la version d20 de Talislanta . Open Legend RPG # Le syst\u00e8me est open source et disponible sur le net . Il semble que ce soit un syst\u00e8me d20, mais il me faudrait plus de temps pour analyser le tout. Palladium/Megaversal-System # Jeux Rifts Robotech Palladium Fantasy RPG Heroes unlimited Pareil, le syst\u00e8me Rifts n'est pas fait pour moi, car trop compliqu\u00e9 et trop coll\u00e9 \u00e0 l'univers de Rifts. Je reviendrai dessus avec plus d'arguments. PbtA - Powered by the Apocalypse # Jeux Apocalypse World Dungeon World Kult 3e Blades in the Dark Ironforged The Spawn Bon, je n'aime pas ces jeux, voir la page sur les jeux PBTA . Bon, enfin, j'ai quand m\u00eame failli acheter Blades in the Dark en occase la derni\u00e8re fois. Pour \u00eatre s\u00fbr. Risus # Risus est un mini-jeu qui peut se jouer dans tous les univers. Allez sur la page d\u00e9di\u00e9e . Rolemaster # Jeux Rolemaster Fantasy Spacemaster MERP Shadow World Cyberspace J'ai la version fran\u00e7aise de Rolemaster d'il y a longtemps mais je n'ai jamais jou\u00e9. J'avais trouv\u00e9 pas mal le jeu dans le pass\u00e9, mais un peu compliqu\u00e9 avec ses dizaines de tables. MERP \u00e9tait une version simplifi\u00e9e. Avec le recul, comme pour L\u00e9gendes, je trouve ces jeux trop complexes. On les dirait issus d'une tradition plus wargame, un monde de sp\u00e9cialistes qui ont le temps de potasser des r\u00e8gles tr\u00e8s complexes et qui aiment, autour de la table, passer du temps \u00e0 les utiliser. Savage Worlds # J'ai failli jouer de nombreuses fois \u00e0 SW mais cela ne s'est jamais fait. J'ai bien lu les r\u00e8gles sans \u00eatre tr\u00e8s emball\u00e9 ni partager l'enthousiasme des fans. Il y en avait beaucoup il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, mais la passion semble \u00eatre un peu retomb\u00e9e. Je suis int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par des suppl\u00e9ments comme Lankhmar que j'ach\u00e8terai peut-\u00eatre un jour. Tri-Stat dX # Jeux BESM Empire of the Petal Throne Silver Age Sentinels On revient dans le monde des syst\u00e8mes D6. J'ai pas mal regard\u00e9 ce syst\u00e8me et je ne peux pas m'emp\u00eacher de le comparer avec GURPS . Je l'avais d\u00e9couvert dans la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition de BESM (2004) au travers d'un suppl\u00e9ment \u00e9crit par John S. Ross, le cr\u00e9ateur de Risus : Uresia, grave of Heaven . Tri-Stat dX GURPS Body Strength-Dexterity Mind IQ Soul Will ou avantages La m\u00e9canique de cr\u00e9ation est tr\u00e8s proche de GURPS : il faut acheter des caract\u00e9ristiques et des skills avec des points. Au lieu d'utiliser 3D6 comme dans GURPS , on roll under avec 2D6. Mouais. Si le syst\u00e8me de jeu de BESM est assez simple, celui de Tri-Stat dX , dans la mesure o\u00f9 il se veut g\u00e9n\u00e9rique avec n'importe quel d\u00e9, devient plus compliqu\u00e9 au point finalement de perdre son int\u00e9r\u00eat. C'est vrai que, m\u00eame si je ne suis pas un fan absolu du syst\u00e8me de jeu de GURPS , je le recommande par rapport \u00e0 Tri-Stat dX True20 # Je suis tomb\u00e9 par hasard sur des publications de Green Ronin , l'\u00e9diteur de True20 , ces derniers mois, notamment sur le Psychic's Handbook que j'avais beaucoup appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 et que je me suis fait imprimer par lulu . Je me suis toujours dit que je hackerai ce syst\u00e8me psionique (extension du syst\u00e8me d20) dans le futur, tant je le trouve int\u00e9ressant. Peut-\u00eatre faire un croisement avec D6 Opera et Space Opera serait la solution \u00e0 mon probl\u00e8me. Mais revenons \u00e0 nos moutons. Je ne sais plus pourquoi je me suis int\u00e9ress\u00e9 au syst\u00e8me True20 , probablement parce que ce syst\u00e8me semblait plus adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 de la SF que les autres syst\u00e8mes d20. J'avais gard\u00e9 dans mes tablettes de me faire une id\u00e9e plus pr\u00e9cise. Il est possible que je le trouve en occase quelque part, j'ai un peu du mal \u00e0 me faire \u00e0 la lecture PDF. Ubiquity Roleplaying System # Jeux Hollow Earth Expedition Revelations of Mars Space 1889 J'ai toujours un peu de mal \u00e0 comprendre pourquoi r\u00e9inventer la roue ou faire des variations cosm\u00e9tiques pour faire diff\u00e9rent. Le syst\u00e8me Ubiquity na\u00eet en 2006 avec Hollow Earth Expedition . Hollow Earth Expedition D&D Body Constitution Dexterity Dexterity Strength Strength Charisma Charisma Intelligence Intelligence Willpower Wisdom Jusqu'ici, c'est tr\u00e8s D&D ! Les secondary attributes sont un refactoring des skills de D&D et de la classe d'armure, les talents sont les feats ... Le syst\u00e8me est bas\u00e9 sur des pools de d\u00e9s et propose quelques variantes en comparaison de D&D \u00e9dition 3.5 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Certes, il n'y a pas de classes, mais malgr\u00e9 son c\u00f4t\u00e9 dice pool , ce syst\u00e8me peut \u00eatre vu comme une variante du d20 ! Ce qui me g\u00e8ne, c'est qu'il est promus comme \u00e9tant innovant et pulp . Mouais.

A l'\u00e9poque, des gars avaient la grosse t\u00eate parce qu'ils avaient lu tout Tolkien en anglais. Cela me laissait perplexe. Certes Cubicle 7 a perdu sa licence mais les ayant-droits dudit Tolkien paraissent un peu psychopathes parce qu'on ne b\u00e2tit pas une gamme en 5 minutes.

Directivit\u00e9 du MJ # Le MJ est trop directif et il ne met pas en place un univers collaboratif o\u00f9 les joueurs peuvent co-construire l'univers avec lui au travers de l'utilisation de la discussion. Pr\u00e9paration du jeu # Le temps de pr\u00e9paration est trop long, trop important, pour les anciens jeux. L'investissement du MJ est trop important. L'investissement demand\u00e9 n'est plus adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 notre monde moderne, que ce soit pour le MJ ou pour les joueurs. Derri\u00e8re cette pr\u00e9occupation mat\u00e9rielle, on retrouve la co-construction de l'histoire et une volont\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er une /dynamique organique/ du jeu. Le jeu se d\u00e9velopperait \"de lui-m\u00eame\" et n'aurait donc pas besoin de guidelines voire de sc\u00e9narios men\u00e9s par un MJ ayant tout p\u00e9par\u00e9 seul. Non int\u00e9graion des derni\u00e8res techniques de jeu # Certaines variantes de jeu ont permis de voir les choses diff\u00e9remment (JDR solo avec \"gamemaster emulator\", JDR sans MJ, etc.) et de pousser les jeux \"narratifs\" et co-construits sur le devant de la sc\u00e8ne. Les anciens jeux n'ont pas inclus ces nouvelles tendances. Des arguments anciens # Les arguments critiques envers les jeux tr\u00e8s lourds en r\u00e8gles (\u00e0 commencer par D&D) \u00e9taient \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames, durant les ann\u00e9es 80/90. La recherche du Graal du jeu bas\u00e9 sur le roleplay et avec tr\u00e8s peu de r\u00e8gles a longtemps occup\u00e9 les colonnes des magazines de JDR. de nombreuses tentatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, sans \u00eatre vraiment couronn\u00e9es de succ\u00e8s. Un nouveau type de jeu # Apocalypse World, le premier jeu de la vague PbtA sort de 2010, soit plus de 20 ans apr\u00e8s ces d\u00e9bats. La famille Baker, qui a design\u00e9 ce jeu, est une famille de quadras \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Nourris par The Forge et la GNS, ils proposent un nouveau type de jeu. Une modification profonde de la vision des PJs # L'avant : des PJs \u00e0 base de chiffres # La premi\u00e8re composante du JDR traditionnel est la composante PJ. Selon comment ces derniers sont structur\u00e9s, les joueurs auront plus ou moins de possibilit\u00e9s. Les r\u00e8gles du jeu organisent les interactions entre les PJ et le monde, ainsi qu'avec les PNJs. Les jeux de r\u00f4les de la premi\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration (D&D, Cthulhu, GURPS, Rolemaster, etc.) sont bas\u00e9s sur une possibilit\u00e9 de comparaison objective entre les PJs, et sur un calibrage des PJs par rapport \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 du monde. Ainsi, dans la plupart des jeux, on trouve, d\u00e9crit en termes de jeu, les principaux animaux. Etablir une \u00e9chelle objective permet aussi de construire et de dimensionner des adversaires PNJ. Certains jeux comme D&D utiliseront la notion de niveau (voir quelques commentaires sur D&D ). Des PJs plus ou moins structur\u00e9s avec des mots ou des expressions # Avec l'apparition de jeux comme Fudge (1992), un \"pont\" est dress\u00e9 entre des valeurs sous forme de nombre (de -3 \u00e0 +3) et des descriptifs qualificatifs portant cette \"valeur\". M\u00eame si la m\u00e9canique sous-jacente est encore \u00e0 base de nombres et de modificateurs, les mots vont prendre progressivement une importance \u00e9norme dans le monde des JDR, jusqu'\u00e0 prendre la place d'attributs, de comp\u00e9tences, de dons, de d\u00e9fauts ou m\u00eame de pouvoirs. Les mots s'imposent dans les cr\u00e9ations des PJs au travers des \"aspects\", des \"clich\u00e9s\", des \"arch\u00e9types\", des \"avatars\", des \"concepts de personnages\", etc. Ces mots peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s durant le jeu pour appeler une m\u00e9canique particuli\u00e8re, le plus souvent un bonus ou une comp\u00e9tence impliqu\u00e9e par ou \"sous-entendue\" dans l'expression elle-m\u00eame. Or, au travers de cette irruption des mots dans les m\u00e9caniques des JDR, les probl\u00e8mes relatifs \u00e0 l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 des mots et des expressions entrent dans le monde du JDR. Des PJs non structur\u00e9s dans des jeux pour v\u00e9t\u00e9rans ? # Il faut une certaine exp\u00e9rience du JDR pour pouvoir d\u00e9finir des /mots et expressions utiles/ au jeu. En un sens, le JDR s'adresse implicitement \u00e0 des v\u00e9t\u00e9rans, voire \u00e0 des v\u00e9t\u00e9rans dans un mode jeu ironique (voire cynique). Ces derniers ont les codes du JDR : ils sauront quelle expression leur permet de \"joueur comme \u00e0 AD&D\". Le discours est que les jeux utilisant des mots rendent le JDR plus accessible aux d\u00e9butants. Etant donn\u00e9 que la logique du jeu est plus complexe \u00e0 comprendre, car souvent implicite, cette assertion n'est pas facilement d\u00e9fendable. Incertitude autour des PJ et des PNJ # Les mots ou phrases introduisent une incertitude autour des personnages , incertitude \u00e0 laquelle le MJ doit s'adapter. En effet, les mots sont vagues, soumis \u00e0 des interpr\u00e9tations et parfois en recouvrement s\u00e9mantique partiel, ce qui rend compliqu\u00e9 leur usage. Cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 est vue comme positive par les tenants de cette m\u00e9canique. Elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie clairement aux joueurs en d\u00e9poss\u00e9dant le MJ d'une partie de ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Les mots et les phrases descriptives des PJ et PNJ introduisent aussi une incertitude dans l'\u00e9quilibre des PJ entre eux et avec les PNJ , et donc une possibilit\u00e9 d'arbitraire pour les MJ. Il devient, en effet, complexe de quantifier les expressions pour \u00e9quilibrer les personnages et les aventures. Favoriser les extravertis # Les mots et les phrases favorisent les joueurs extravertis qui pourront interpr\u00e9ter de mani\u00e8re libre un \"clich\u00e9\" alors que les introvertis seront desservis par des r\u00e8gles bas\u00e9es sur des mots et sur le besoin d'improviser oralement pour les interpr\u00e9ter. Dans les jeux classiques, les joueurs utilisent des \u00e9chelles objectives, ce qui permet \u00e0 tous d'avoir une \u00e9chelle commune pour s'exprimer. Deux types de MJ # Les jeux \u00e0 base de mots sont des jeux tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifiques dans lesquels le MJ doit investir pour comprendre comment utiliser ces mots ou expressions plus ou moins libres et plus ou moins contraintes par le game designer. Cet investissement est souvent li\u00e9 \u00e0 la recherche d'un m\u00e9canisme ressemblant \u00e0 une \u00e9chelle objective. D'autres MJ, en revanche, se satisferont du c\u00f4t\u00e9 plus \"libre\" d'un jeu bas\u00e9 sur les mots et sur les interpr\u00e9tations des joueurs et du MJ. Le fait de moins structurer les personnages, qu'ils soient joueurs ou non, permet de laisser place \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation et \u00e0 la co-cr\u00e9ation du jeu. Les PJ ne sont pas dans un monde de r\u00e8gles objectives qui les contraint, ils sont \"racont\u00e9s\" par le MJ et les joueurs. Peut-\u00eatre est-on face \u00e0 deux types de MJ : des MJ scientifiques aimant les \u00e9chelles absolues et les MJ litt\u00e9raires aimant l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 des mots. La structuration du \"backgound\" des personnages # Le JDR narratif apporte une obsession \u00e9trange : celle de la structuration du background. Dans la plupart des jeux anciens, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un background \u00e0 son personnage, cela \u00e9tait plus ou moins fait, et disons que le background s'enrichissait au fur et \u00e0 mesure des parties. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, m\u00eame dans les jeux modernes, les aventures pass\u00e9es des PJ devenaient rapidement leur backgound principal. Beaucoup de jeux plus r\u00e9cents \u00e9tablissent une vraie dictature du background en exigeant de le structurer de mani\u00e8re sch\u00e9matique voire caricaturale, en termes de jeu. Ainsi, on voit appara\u00eetre, en plus de la notion de \"clich\u00e9\" ou d'\"arch\u00e9type\" : Une certaine obsession pour les d\u00e9fauts des PJ , souvent utiles pour gagner des points dans le processus de cr\u00e9ation, parfois obligatoires dans le processus, souvent en contrepartie des dons ; Des contacts sociaux obligatoires, Un ennemi jur\u00e9 obligatoire, Etc. Cette sch\u00e9matisation \u00e0 outrance du background des personnages concourt \u00e0 en faire des caricatures, semblant \u00eatre issues du m\u00eame moule, et \u00e0 rendre suffocant l'univers des personnages. Dans une conception ancienne, le PJ doit \u00eatre libre avant tout et n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre \"backgroundis\u00e9\" arbitrairement au travers de dimensions caricaturales. Ce sujet est d\u00e9licat, car il s'agit d'un probl\u00e8me de curseur. La structuration du background des personnages a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 un sujet dans le JDR, mais dans des jeux comme PbtA, il semble que le bouchon soit pouss\u00e9 plus loin. Les playbooks : des caricatures de classes de PJ ? # La notion de classe ne dispara\u00eet pas dans les jeux de type PbtA, on pourrait m\u00eame dire qu'elle s'hyper-sp\u00e9cialise. Au travers des \"playbooks\", il est difficile de savoir si l'on joue un personnage pr\u00e9tir\u00e9 ou un personnage d'une classe de personnage tr\u00e8s \"\u00e9troite\". D'autant qu'au sein d'une partie, un seul personnage d'un certain type ne peut \u00eatre jou\u00e9 dans le groupe. Le besoin de customiser le playbook est donc limit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plus simple expression, car le personnage est d\u00e9j\u00e0 si sp\u00e9cifique, qu'il ne m\u00e9rite qu'un \"acteur\" pour l'incarner. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, la logique des playbooks \u00e9quivaut, pour les jeux plus anciens, \u00e0 une logique de personnages pr\u00e9tir\u00e9s. Garantir la bonne r\u00e9partition des r\u00f4les implique, tout comme dans D&D, \u00e9quilibrer un groupe pour une aventure. Des caricatures de PJ pour un petit univers ? # Si l'on m\u00e8le description textuelle et playbooks, nous voyons un JDR o\u00f9 les personnages ont tendance \u00e0 \u00eatre des caricatures. La volont\u00e9 de jouer des caricatures semble clairement influenc\u00e9e par : Les films et s\u00e9ries, Les jeux vid\u00e9os, Les comics et les mangas. Or, jouer des caricatures ou des arch\u00e9types de personnages de films ou de BD offre, pour certains joueurs et MJ, des possibilit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es. Ou disons que cette approche permet de jouer des aventures ressemblant \u00e0 des films ou des s\u00e9ries, mais sur des styles souvent tr\u00e8s \u00e9troits, voire vraiment tr\u00e8s \u00e9troits. Cette r\u00e9duction de l'univers de jeu semble une caract\u00e9ristique des jeux PbtA. Les PJ arch\u00e9typaux \u00e9voluent dans un monde restreint, arch\u00e9typal, dans une niche ou une sous-niche. Notons que cette caract\u00e9ristique implique la multiplication des jeux, nous y reviendrons. Dans des jeux plus traditionnels, les r\u00e8gles permettent de g\u00e9rer l'univers de jeu qui, par nature, est vaste, voire - on aime \u00e0 le penser - infini. La partie \"libert\u00e9 des personnages \u00e0 interagir avec le reste du monde\" est une dimension importante du jeu de r\u00f4les, d'o\u00f9 les cartes des mondes avec des d\u00e9tails \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9chelles. Le MJ est garant de ce monde qui, en aucun cas, ne serait se limit\u00e9 aux quelques arch\u00e9types du genre. Le fait m\u00eame qu'il soit vaste laisse le champ pour la surprise et pour l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des campagnes. Le style m\u00eame des aventures peut changer d'une aventure \u00e0 l'autre. Si une aventure est ax\u00e9e sur l'exploration et les combats, une seconde peut \u00eatre une enqu\u00eate et une troisi\u00e8me peut avoir un sc\u00e9nario de film d'horreur. En fait, c'est comme si les jeux de super-h\u00e9ros avaient gagn\u00e9 en esprit sur certains JDR : il semble qu'il faille jouer des caricatures standardis\u00e9es dans les jeux modernes, des personnages de s\u00e9rie t\u00e9l\u00e9, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement fabriqu\u00e9s pour \u00e9voluer dans un certain genre de s\u00e9ries tr\u00e8s \u00e9troit (sous-genre ou sous-sous-genre). Les \"move\" # Si les PJs ont chang\u00e9 dans des jeux PbtA, les m\u00e9caniques de jeu aussi. Dans certains jeux relativement r\u00e9cents, les mots sont utilis\u00e9s pour les \"move\", des genres d'actions g\u00e9n\u00e9riques que les PJ peuvent faire, ces actions \u00e9tant adapt\u00e9es au sous-genre propos\u00e9 par le jeu. Le game designer impose, en plus de tout ce que nous avons vu, une certaine mani\u00e8re de jouer les personnages en d\u00e9terminant les \"move\" par type de personnage, pour tous les types, ainsi que pour le MJ. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, ces moves sont sp\u00e9cifiques au jeu, peu faciles \u00e0 comprendre et \u00e0 utiliser, et en recouvrement s\u00e9mantique les uns avec les autres (ce qui est souvent volontaire). Si l'on examine finement des jeux comme Apocalypse World , on se rend compte que les moves des PJ et du MC (Master of Ceremony, un genre de \"MJ light et collaboratif\") semblent se r\u00e9pondre et avoir fait l'objet de simulations par ordinateur. En contraignant les actions possibles des PJ, et en cat\u00e9gorisant les diff\u00e9rentes actions possibles du MC, le jeu donne l'impression de mettre en place une chor\u00e9graphie bien adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 certains jeux ou univers, mais au final tr\u00e8s m\u00e9caniste, et dont les r\u00e9sultats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \"optimis\u00e9s\" dans des simulateurs inaccessibles aux joueurs et au MJ. Certes, le jeu poss\u00e8de une certaine dynamique organique dont nous parlions auparavant, et donc fournit les effets promis. Mais cela est rendu possible au travers des encha\u00eenements de moves entre PJ et MC, ces derni\u00e8res ayant fait l'objet de simulations informatis\u00e9es ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es dans le game design. Les moves ne sont donc pas des vraies comp\u00e9tences, mais plus, comme leur nom l'indique, des actions appelant d'autres moves. Le glissement s\u00e9mantique est subtil, mais r\u00e9el : dans une situation, l'utilisation d'un move appelle un autre move \"compatible\" en face, et donc restreint m\u00e9caniquement les possibilit\u00e9s de jeu, en favorisant des \"mod\u00e8les d'action\" ( action patterns ) arch\u00e9typaux au genre ou sous-genre consid\u00e9r\u00e9. Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et jeu de plateau # Nous sommes donc devant une nouvelle cat\u00e9gorie de jeux ayant les caract\u00e9ristiques suivantes : Les personnages sont des arch\u00e9types (playbook) aux actions arch\u00e9typales (move). Pour les anciens r\u00f4listes, ce sont des \"personnages pr\u00e9tir\u00e9s\". Les playbooks vont au del\u00e0 des classes de personnages de D&D pour qui la classe est un moyen de progresser dans une certaine voie. Les aventures sont \u00e9tudi\u00e9es et optimis\u00e9es pour ces arch\u00e9types ayant ces actions arch\u00e9typales. Le joueur doit endosser l'arch\u00e9type, jouer le personnage pr\u00e9tir\u00e9 et utiliser ses actions (move) pr\u00e9d\u00e9finis. S'il ne le joue pas, l'histoire et sa dynamique peuvent \u00eatre perturb\u00e9es. Nous sommes donc dans une perspective plus th\u00e9\u00e2trale que libre, un th\u00e9\u00e2tre aux dimensions contraintes par le game designer. Le canevas impos\u00e9 aux joueurs semble plus dur que le canevas impos\u00e9 par les anciens jeux. Retour au jeu de plateau # Si les moves devenaient des cartes physiques et les playbooks des fiches cartonn\u00e9es, nous pourrions \u00eatre dans un jeu de plateau, type jeu de strat\u00e9gie. Une sc\u00e8ne devient alors une s\u00e9rie de cartes \u00e0 action que chaque jouer abat \u00e0 son tour (PJ et MC ou PJ et PJ). Chaque joueur aurait une s\u00e9rie de moves sous forme de cartes, ainsi que le MC. Chacun abat ses cartes en r\u00e9action aux actions de l'autre. Certaines r\u00e9actions sont faisables et d'autres inadapt\u00e9es. Les jeux de type PbtA ne sont donc pas des JDR classiques mais ressemblent plus \u00e0 des jeux hybrides entre jeu de r\u00f4le, jeu de cartes (genre Magic the Gathering) et jeu de plateau. L'\u00e9ternel retour # Au travers des jeux PbtA, le JDR vit donc, au sens strict du terme, une \"r\u00e9gression\" : l\u00e0 o\u00f9 Gary Gygax avait sorti le jeu de r\u00f4les du monde du jeu de plateau de strat\u00e9gie, PbtA nous ram\u00e8ne vers le jeu de plateau avec les m\u00eames buts : Cr\u00e9er un jeu optimis\u00e9 pour un sous-genre, voire un sous-sous-genre ; Cr\u00e9er des arch\u00e9types de personnages taill\u00e9s pour le sous-genre et aux actions limit\u00e9es pour ob\u00e9ir aux r\u00e8gles du sous-genre (dans l'esprit d'une \"s\u00e9rie\") ; Contraindre les joueurs et le MJ \u00e0 \u00e9voluer dans un narratif qui contraint les PJ dans une sandbox, dans un univers de possibles limit\u00e9s, o\u00f9 les moves ont \u00e9t\u00e9 optimis\u00e9s pour cr\u00e9er m\u00e9caniquement une dynamique de jeu organique. Une des cons\u00e9quences est le c\u00f4t\u00e9 parfois extr\u00eamement brutal ou exp\u00e9ditif du jeu, cela de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s surprenante pour les pratiquants des anciens JDR. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 les anciens JDR proposaient des approches plus progressives (difficult\u00e9s pour les joueurs \u00e0 mesurer les risques d'une action, m\u00e9canique d'aggravation des situations suite \u00e0 \u00e9chec, etc.), tout peut basculer tr\u00e8s vite dans le monde PbtA. En fait, ce genre de jeux est tout \u00e0 fait pertinent et il est normal qu'il s\u00e9duise un certain public. Mais il est aussi normal que d'autres joueurs ne l'appr\u00e9cient pas, car c'est un autre type de jeu.","title":"Analyse des jeux PbtA"},{"location":"pages/pbta/#historique","text":"La vague PbtA a commenc\u00e9 par des discussions sur le forum The Forge .

Dans la plupart des jeux anciens, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un background \u00e0 son personnage, cela \u00e9tait plus ou moins fait, et disons que le background s'enrichissait au fur et \u00e0 mesure des parties. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, m\u00eame dans les jeux modernes, les aventures pass\u00e9es des PJ devenaient rapidement leur backgound principal. Beaucoup de jeux plus r\u00e9cents \u00e9tablissent une vraie dictature du background en exigeant de le structurer de mani\u00e8re sch\u00e9matique voire caricaturale, en termes de jeu. Ainsi, on voit appara\u00eetre, en plus de la notion de \"clich\u00e9\" ou d'\"arch\u00e9type\" : Une certaine obsession pour les d\u00e9fauts des PJ , souvent utiles pour gagner des points dans le processus de cr\u00e9ation, parfois obligatoires dans le processus, souvent en contrepartie des dons ; Des contacts sociaux obligatoires, Un ennemi jur\u00e9 obligatoire, Etc. Cette sch\u00e9matisation \u00e0 outrance du background des personnages concourt \u00e0 en faire des caricatures, semblant \u00eatre issues du m\u00eame moule, et \u00e0 rendre suffocant l'univers des personnages. Dans une conception ancienne, le PJ doit \u00eatre libre avant tout et n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre \"backgroundis\u00e9\" arbitrairement au travers de dimensions caricaturales. Ce sujet est d\u00e9licat, car il s'agit d'un probl\u00e8me de curseur. La structuration du background des personnages a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 un sujet dans le JDR, mais dans des jeux comme PbtA, il semble que le bouchon soit pouss\u00e9 plus loin.","title":"La structuration du \"backgound\" des personnages"},{"location":"pages/pbta/#les-playbooks-des-caricatures-de-classes-de-pj","text":"La notion de classe ne dispara\u00eet pas dans les jeux de type PbtA, on pourrait m\u00eame dire qu'elle s'hyper-sp\u00e9cialise.

D'autant qu'au sein d'une partie, un seul personnage d'un certain type ne peut \u00eatre jou\u00e9 dans le groupe. Le besoin de customiser le playbook est donc limit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plus simple expression, car le personnage est d\u00e9j\u00e0 si sp\u00e9cifique, qu'il ne m\u00e9rite qu'un \"acteur\" pour l'incarner.

La volont\u00e9 de jouer des caricatures semble clairement influenc\u00e9e par : Les films et s\u00e9ries, Les jeux vid\u00e9os, Les comics et les mangas. Or, jouer des caricatures ou des arch\u00e9types de personnages de films ou de BD offre, pour certains joueurs et MJ, des possibilit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es. Ou disons que cette approche permet de jouer des aventures ressemblant \u00e0 des films ou des s\u00e9ries, mais sur des styles souvent tr\u00e8s \u00e9troits, voire vraiment tr\u00e8s \u00e9troits. Cette r\u00e9duction de l'univers de jeu semble une caract\u00e9ristique des jeux PbtA. Les PJ arch\u00e9typaux \u00e9voluent dans un monde restreint, arch\u00e9typal, dans une niche ou une sous-niche. Notons que cette caract\u00e9ristique implique la multiplication des jeux, nous y reviendrons. Dans des jeux plus traditionnels, les r\u00e8gles permettent de g\u00e9rer l'univers de jeu qui, par nature, est vaste, voire - on aime \u00e0 le penser - infini. La partie \"libert\u00e9 des personnages \u00e0 interagir avec le reste du monde\" est une dimension importante du jeu de r\u00f4les, d'o\u00f9 les cartes des mondes avec des d\u00e9tails \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9chelles. Le MJ est garant de ce monde qui, en aucun cas, ne serait se limit\u00e9 aux quelques arch\u00e9types du genre. Le fait m\u00eame qu'il soit vaste laisse le champ pour la surprise et pour l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des campagnes. Le style m\u00eame des aventures peut changer d'une aventure \u00e0 l'autre. Si une aventure est ax\u00e9e sur l'exploration et les combats, une seconde peut \u00eatre une enqu\u00eate et une troisi\u00e8me peut avoir un sc\u00e9nario de film d'horreur. En fait, c'est comme si les jeux de super-h\u00e9ros avaient gagn\u00e9 en esprit sur certains JDR : il semble qu'il faille jouer des caricatures standardis\u00e9es dans les jeux modernes, des personnages de s\u00e9rie t\u00e9l\u00e9, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement fabriqu\u00e9s pour \u00e9voluer dans un certain genre de s\u00e9ries tr\u00e8s \u00e9troit (sous-genre ou sous-sous-genre).","title":"Des caricatures de PJ pour un petit univers ?"},{"location":"pages/pbta/#les-move","text":"Si les PJs ont chang\u00e9 dans des jeux PbtA, les m\u00e9caniques de jeu aussi. Dans certains jeux relativement r\u00e9cents, les mots sont utilis\u00e9s pour les \"move\", des genres d'actions g\u00e9n\u00e9riques que les PJ peuvent faire, ces actions \u00e9tant adapt\u00e9es au sous-genre propos\u00e9 par le jeu. Le game designer impose, en plus de tout ce que nous avons vu, une certaine mani\u00e8re de jouer les personnages en d\u00e9terminant les \"move\" par type de personnage, pour tous les types, ainsi que pour le MJ. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, ces moves sont sp\u00e9cifiques au jeu, peu faciles \u00e0 comprendre et \u00e0 utiliser, et en recouvrement s\u00e9mantique les uns avec les autres (ce qui est souvent volontaire). Si l'on examine finement des jeux comme Apocalypse World , on se rend compte que les moves des PJ et du MC (Master of Ceremony, un genre de \"MJ light et collaboratif\") semblent se r\u00e9pondre et avoir fait l'objet de simulations par ordinateur. En contraignant les actions possibles des PJ, et en cat\u00e9gorisant les diff\u00e9rentes actions possibles du MC, le jeu donne l'impression de mettre en place une chor\u00e9graphie bien adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 certains jeux ou univers, mais au final tr\u00e8s m\u00e9caniste, et dont les r\u00e9sultats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \"optimis\u00e9s\" dans des simulateurs inaccessibles aux joueurs et au MJ. Certes, le jeu poss\u00e8de une certaine dynamique organique dont nous parlions auparavant, et donc fournit les effets promis. Mais cela est rendu possible au travers des encha\u00eenements de moves entre PJ et MC, ces derni\u00e8res ayant fait l'objet de simulations informatis\u00e9es ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es dans le game design. Les moves ne sont donc pas des vraies comp\u00e9tences, mais plus, comme leur nom l'indique, des actions appelant d'autres moves. Le glissement s\u00e9mantique est subtil, mais r\u00e9el : dans une situation, l'utilisation d'un move appelle un autre move \"compatible\" en face, et donc restreint m\u00e9caniquement les possibilit\u00e9s de jeu, en favorisant des \"mod\u00e8les d'action\" ( action patterns ) arch\u00e9typaux au genre ou sous-genre consid\u00e9r\u00e9.","title":"Les \"move\""},{"location":"pages/pbta/#theatre-et-jeu-de-plateau","text":"Nous sommes donc devant une nouvelle cat\u00e9gorie de jeux ayant les caract\u00e9ristiques suivantes : Les personnages sont des arch\u00e9types (playbook) aux actions arch\u00e9typales (move).

Les playbooks vont au del\u00e0 des classes de personnages de D&D pour qui la classe est un moyen de progresser dans une certaine voie. Les aventures sont \u00e9tudi\u00e9es et optimis\u00e9es pour ces arch\u00e9types ayant ces actions arch\u00e9typales.

Dans cet article, nous nous limiterons \u00e0 l'usage du terme \"psychique\" en fran\u00e7ais, le terme \"psionic\" \u00e9tant r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 la citation d'ouvrages en anglais. 1976 - OD&D au d\u00e9but de tout (comme souvent) # Introduction # En 1976 sort le livre VI de Dungeons & Dragons avec le titre Eldritch Wizardry cosign\u00e9 de Gary Gygax et de Brain Blume. Ce livre d'une soixantaine de pages contient essentiellement des suppl\u00e9ments sur les pouvoirs psychiques, sur le druide en tant que classe de personnage et sur les d\u00e9mons. Ledit suppl\u00e9ment est disponible sur archive.org . Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 ma connaissance alors que les r\u00e8gles de OD&D l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 : voir sur le tr\u00e8s bon site La Forge de papier . Il semble que ce soit la premi\u00e8re apparition des pouvoirs psychiques dans le monde du JDR. Leur apparition au sein de D&D a quelque chose d'\u00e9trange, car on pourrait y voir une collision de diverses influences dans la fantasy: le m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique qui favorise la magie et les pouvoirs psychiques qui sent plus le JDR contemporain ou futuriste. D&D propose les pouvoirs psy comme un genre de suppl\u00e9ment optionnel pour \"pimenter\" les parties. L'introduction de 1976 de Tim Kask dudit livre est amusante : L'introduction du combat psionique s'attache \u00e0 redynamiser des jeux devenus ternes. Cela ouvre des possibilit\u00e9s in\u00e9dites \u00e0 la fois pour les joueurs et le MD et, ce faisant, cela permet de se reconnecter \u00e0 l'un des th\u00e8mes favoris des \u00e9crivains de science-fiction et de fantasy : les pouvoirs inconnus de l'esprit. Pour autant, en lisant entre les lignes, l'introduction des d\u00e9mons dans le jeu semble pousser Gygax \u00e0 cr\u00e9er les r\u00e8gles des pouvoirs psychiques, mieux adapt\u00e9s, selon lui, \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les pouvoirs de certains d\u00e9mons. Comme souvent dans OD&D, les r\u00e8gles sont confuses, incompl\u00e8tes, \u00e9clat\u00e9es dans le tout le livret, entrecoup\u00e9es de choses qui n'ont rien \u00e0 voir (le Druide, un syst\u00e8me de combat alternatif bas\u00e9 sur la Dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 Ajust\u00e9e , etc.). Au niveau \u00e9dition, Eldritch Wizardry est un des pires exemples de l'\u00e9poque. Obtention des Pouvoirs Psychiques (PoP) # A la cr\u00e9ation du PJ, un score de 15 ou plus dans INTelligence, WISdom ou CHArisma donne la possibilit\u00e9 de tester si le personnage dispose d'un pouvoir psy (si le personnage est humain). Il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire 91 ou plus sur 1d100 pour que ce soit le cas. Les moines et les druides ne peuvent pas avoir de pouvoirs psychiques. Si le personnage est \u00e9ligible, il faut faire un nouveau jet de 1d100 pour d\u00e9terminer le potentiel psychique (PP, purement al\u00e9atoire). Suivant le PP, le PJ obtient un malus ou un bonus pour avoir des pouvoirs psychiques (PoP, de -6% \u00e0 +3%). PP (1d100) Bonus/Malus au jet d'obtention de PoP (BMPoP) 01\u201310 -6% par niveau (cumulatif) 11\u201325 -5% par niveau (cumulatif) 26\u201350 -4% par niveau (cumulatif) 51\u201375 Aucun 76\u201390 +1% par niveau (cumulatif) 91\u201399 +2% par niveau (cumulatif) 00 +3% par niveau (cumulatif) La chance de base pour avoir un PoP est de 10% + BMPoP par niveau. Ainsi, un perso du 4\u00e8me niveau avec un PP de 90 aura une base de 10 + 1 = 11 soit 11 x 4 = 44% de chances d'avoir un PoP. Cela veut dire aussi qu'un personnage de niveau 10 aura 100% d'avoir un PoP. Notons enfin que donc, ce jet se produit \u00e0 chaque changement de niveau. Cerise sur le g\u00e2teau : si le PJ obtient un PoP, alors s'il r\u00e9ussit un jet de 1d100 sous son PP, il en a automatiquement un second ! Nous sommes en plein dans le monde Gygaxien des r\u00e8gles gigognes : R1 : INT ou WIS ou CHA > 15, R2 : Si R1 OK, jet de 1d100 pour PP et BMPoP, R3 : Quand R2 OK, jet de BMPoP pour obtenir un PoP, R4 : Si R3 OK, si succ\u00e8s, alors jet de PP pour obtenir un second PoP. Nous verrons appara\u00eetre ce genre de r\u00e8gles gigognes dans les autres \u00e9ditions de D&D sign\u00e9es de Gygax.

Le fait qu'un PoP soit Sup\u00e9rieur ne se traduit (dans les r\u00e8gles) que par le fait qu'elle soit d\u00e9tectable par un autre personnage ayant des pouvoirs psy au double de la port\u00e9e du pouvoir (voir plus bas d\u00e9tection des pouvoirs psychiques). Les PJ ne peuvent pas avoir plus de PoP Sup\u00e9rieurs que de PoP Basiques. Cette distinction est peu d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e et on imagine que le but \u00e9tait d'avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de deux puissances diff\u00e9rentes dans les m\u00eames pouvoirs. Par contre, les pouvoirs eux-m\u00eames n'utilisent pas cette distinction. La d\u00e9termination des PoPs est al\u00e9atoire mais il est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de restreindre le choix \u00e0 des types de PoP coh\u00e9rents. A - Contr\u00f4le de la mati\u00e8re et de l'\u00e9nergie # On retrouve dans cette dimension pas mal de pouvoirs : R\u00e9duction ; Expansion ; L\u00e9vitation, qui est un moyen de changer le poids du corps ; Changer le poids du corps ( Body Equilibrium ), notamment pour marcher sur l'eau ; Corps comme arme ( Body Weaponry ) ; R\u00e9arrangement mol\u00e9culaire, qui transforme les m\u00e9taux ; Manipulation mol\u00e9culaire, qui permet de rendre fragile diff\u00e9rentes mati\u00e8res dures ; Contr\u00f4le du corps, qui permet d'adapter le corps \u00e0 des conditions extr\u00eames comme le froid extr\u00eame, le feu, les fum\u00e9es empoisonn\u00e9es, etc. ; Barri\u00e8re mentale ; Agitation mol\u00e9culaire, agit un peu comme un four \u00e0 micro-ondes ; Alt\u00e9ration de la forme, pour se changer en quelqu'un d'autre ; Contr\u00f4le de l'esprit sur le corps, pour se passer de manger, de boire et de dormir ; Invisibilit\u00e9 ; Hibernation ( Suspend Animation ), ou comment suspendre ses fonctions vitales ; T\u00e9l\u00e9kin\u00e9sie, contr\u00f4le du mouvement des objets par la pens\u00e9e ; Contr\u00f4le de l'\u00e9nergie, ou comment dissiper des \u00e9nergies agressives ; Contr\u00f4le cellulaire ( Cellular Adjustment ), qui permet de soigner les blessures et les maladies. B - Contr\u00f4le via l'esprit de l'esprit # On retrouve les pouvoirs suivants : Domination, pour forcer une personne \u00e0 faire ce que le PJ souhaite ; Hypnose, contr\u00f4le des esprits faibles ; Projection t\u00e9l\u00e9pathique, envoyer des messages ou influence une personne ; Alt\u00e9ration de l'aura ; Domination des masses ; ESP ; Empathie ; T\u00e9l\u00e9pathie animale. C - Sens # On retrouve les pouvoirs suivants : Pr\u00e9monition ; Clairaudience ; Clairvoyance ; D\u00e9tection du mal/du bien ; D\u00e9tection de la magie. D - Voyage psychique # Marche dimensionnelle ; Projection astrale ; Porte dimensionnelle T\u00e9l\u00e9portation Substance \u00e9th\u00e9r\u00e9e ; Voyage probabiliste, une projection astrale avec le corps permettant de passer \u00e0 travers les plans et les mondes parall\u00e8les (comme dans la Saga des Princes d'Ambres de Zelazni). Modes d'Attaque et Modes de D\u00e9fense # Une fois que le PJ a son premier PoP, il gagne son premier Mode d'Attaque psychique (MA) : Explosion psionique (voir tableau ci-dessous). Les autres MA sont gagn\u00e9s tous les 4 PoP (5 pour les Guerriers). Cette derni\u00e8re consigne est un peu vague. Elle sous-entend que, lors du passage de niveau, le PJ ayant des pouvoirs psychiques va refaire un test pour avoir un nouveau PoP (sachant qu'il peut en obtenir au maximum deux par niveau). Il gagnera un mode d'attaque alors en fonction du nombre de PoP dont il dispose. Concernant les Modes de D\u00e9fense (MD), encore une fois les r\u00e8gles ne sont pas claires. Il est dit qu'ils sont acquis \u00e0 raison de un tous les 3 PoP acquis (4 pour les Guerriers). Comme les PJs ayant des pouvoirs psychiques sont capables de combattre psychiquement, il faut supposer que les MDs marchent comme pour les MAs et que le PJ gagne son premier MD avec son premier PoP, puis ensuite tous les 3 (ou 4) PoP acquis. Une autre interpr\u00e9tation possible serait qu'il faut vraiment avoir 3 ou 4 PoP pour gagner son premier MD. Je trouve cette interpr\u00e9tation un peu bizarre au regard de la suite qui pr\u00e9suppose, dans le combat psionique, que l'attaquant psy a un MA et que le d\u00e9fenseur a un MD. Un d\u00e9fenseur ayant des pouvoirs psychiques sans MD ouvre une br\u00e8che dans le syst\u00e8me. Il n'est pas expliqu\u00e9 comment les MA/MD sont attribu\u00e9s : al\u00e9atoirement (D6 en rejouant le 6) ou s\u00e9quentiellement, en utilisant les lettres, ou par simple choix. Comme la puissance de ces attaques est diverse et non lin\u00e9aire, je pense pas que les lettres soient tr\u00e8s importantes pour les MA. Pour les MD, il y a une certaine progression. Au DM de choisir son mode d'attribution. La liste des modes d'attaque et de d\u00e9fense est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ci-dessous avec leur co\u00fbt en Force Psionique entre parenth\u00e8ses. Modes d'Attaque (MA), toutes classes Modes de D\u00e9fense (MD), toutes classes A. Explosion psionique (20)[x3] F. Esprit vide (1) B. Pouss\u00e9e de l'esprit (10)[x1] G.

Tour de volont\u00e9 de fer (10) \u2660 Si le PJ poss\u00e8de moins de 25 points de FP, il est demand\u00e9 au MJ de \"modifier la probabilit\u00e9 de succ\u00e8s de mani\u00e8re ad hoc \". L'utilisation des MAs peut \u00eatre d\u00e9tect\u00e9e par un PJ ou PNJ ayant des pouvoirs psychiques. Le facteur entre crochets donne le multiplicateur de port\u00e9e du MA dans lequel le PJ ou PNJ peut d\u00e9tecter son usage. Pour m\u00e9moire, les pouvoirs Force Psionique (FP), Force Psionique d'Attaque (FPA) et de D\u00e9fense (FPD) # Les formules sont les suivantes : FPA = PP + 2 x nombre(PoP) + 5 x nombre(MA) + 5 x nombre(MD) FPD = FPA FP = FPA + FPD = 2 x FPA Ces scores serviront de r\u00e9servoirs de points pour les attaques et les d\u00e9fenses psychiques en combat psychique, mais aussi pour les divers PoP que les PJs auront accumul\u00e9s et dont le co\u00fbt est expliqu\u00e9 dans les descriptions. A chaque fois que de la FP est consomm\u00e9e, il faut r\u00e9partir la consommation \u00e0 50%-50% entre la FPA et la FPD, cela pour toutes les consommations. En gros, la FP est un r\u00e9servoir de points divis\u00e9s en deux avec une consommation \u00e9gale dans les deux sous-r\u00e9servoirs (cela vaut aussi pour la consommation des points en combat, soit avec les MA et MD). La FP se r\u00e9cup\u00e8re assez vite en cessant toute activit\u00e9 psychique et en suivant les indications de la table suivante. Activit\u00e9 Gain en FP Marcher, parler et autres activit\u00e9s 6 points par heure Se reposer tranquillement 12 points par heure Dormir 24 points par heure D\u00e9tection des PoP et des MA # La table ci-dessous pr\u00e9sente les r\u00e8gles de d\u00e9tection des PoP et MA (nous avons utilis\u00e9 les lettres pour d\u00e9signer les MA) de PJs ou PNJs ayant des pouvoirs psychiques et d\u00e9tectant dans leur voisinage des cr\u00e9atures utilisant des pouvoirs.

La cr\u00e9ature qui d\u00e9tecte ne pourra pas d\u00e9tecter un pouvoir qu'elle n'a pas, mais pourra, au premier tour d\u00e9tecter dans quelle direction le pouvoir est utilis\u00e9, et au second tour avec quelle puissance \"relative\" ce pouvoir est utilis\u00e9. Les sorts qui sont similaires aux pouvoirs psychiques seront d\u00e9tect\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que lesdits pouvoirs. Les objets magiques qui ont les m\u00eames fonctions que les objets psychiques seront, eux-aussi, d\u00e9tect\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on.

Ce livre d'une soixantaine de pages contient essentiellement des suppl\u00e9ments sur les pouvoirs psychiques, sur le druide en tant que classe de personnage et sur les d\u00e9mons. Ledit suppl\u00e9ment est disponible sur archive.org . Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 ma connaissance alors que les r\u00e8gles de OD&D l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 : voir sur le tr\u00e8s bon site La Forge de papier . Il semble que ce soit la premi\u00e8re apparition des pouvoirs psychiques dans le monde du JDR. Leur apparition au sein de D&D a quelque chose d'\u00e9trange, car on pourrait y voir une collision de diverses influences dans la fantasy: le m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique qui favorise la magie et les pouvoirs psychiques qui sent plus le JDR contemporain ou futuriste. D&D propose les pouvoirs psy comme un genre de suppl\u00e9ment optionnel pour \"pimenter\" les parties. L'introduction de 1976 de Tim Kask dudit livre est amusante : L'introduction du combat psionique s'attache \u00e0 redynamiser des jeux devenus ternes. Cela ouvre des possibilit\u00e9s in\u00e9dites \u00e0 la fois pour les joueurs et le MD et, ce faisant, cela permet de se reconnecter \u00e0 l'un des th\u00e8mes favoris des \u00e9crivains de science-fiction et de fantasy : les pouvoirs inconnus de l'esprit. Pour autant, en lisant entre les lignes, l'introduction des d\u00e9mons dans le jeu semble pousser Gygax \u00e0 cr\u00e9er les r\u00e8gles des pouvoirs psychiques, mieux adapt\u00e9s, selon lui, \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les pouvoirs de certains d\u00e9mons. Comme souvent dans OD&D, les r\u00e8gles sont confuses, incompl\u00e8tes, \u00e9clat\u00e9es dans le tout le livret, entrecoup\u00e9es de choses qui n'ont rien \u00e0 voir (le Druide, un syst\u00e8me de combat alternatif bas\u00e9 sur la Dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 Ajust\u00e9e , etc.). Au niveau \u00e9dition, Eldritch Wizardry est un des pires exemples de l'\u00e9poque.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"pages/psionics/#obtention-des-pouvoirs-psychiques-pop","text":"A la cr\u00e9ation du PJ, un score de 15 ou plus dans INTelligence, WISdom ou CHArisma donne la possibilit\u00e9 de tester si le personnage dispose d'un pouvoir psy (si le personnage est humain). Il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire 91 ou plus sur 1d100 pour que ce soit le cas. Les moines et les druides ne peuvent pas avoir de pouvoirs psychiques. Si le personnage est \u00e9ligible, il faut faire un nouveau jet de 1d100 pour d\u00e9terminer le potentiel psychique (PP, purement al\u00e9atoire). Suivant le PP, le PJ obtient un malus ou un bonus pour avoir des pouvoirs psychiques (PoP, de -6% \u00e0 +3%). PP (1d100) Bonus/Malus au jet d'obtention de PoP (BMPoP) 01\u201310 -6% par niveau (cumulatif) 11\u201325 -5% par niveau (cumulatif) 26\u201350 -4% par niveau (cumulatif) 51\u201375 Aucun 76\u201390 +1% par niveau (cumulatif) 91\u201399 +2% par niveau (cumulatif) 00 +3% par niveau (cumulatif) La chance de base pour avoir un PoP est de 10% + BMPoP par niveau. Ainsi, un perso du 4\u00e8me niveau avec un PP de 90 aura une base de 10 + 1 = 11 soit 11 x 4 = 44% de chances d'avoir un PoP. Cela veut dire aussi qu'un personnage de niveau 10 aura 100% d'avoir un PoP. Notons enfin que donc, ce jet se produit \u00e0 chaque changement de niveau. Cerise sur le g\u00e2teau : si le PJ obtient un PoP, alors s'il r\u00e9ussit un jet de 1d100 sous son PP, il en a automatiquement un second ! Nous sommes en plein dans le monde Gygaxien des r\u00e8gles gigognes : R1 : INT ou WIS ou CHA > 15, R2 : Si R1 OK, jet de 1d100 pour PP et BMPoP, R3 : Quand R2 OK, jet de BMPoP pour obtenir un PoP, R4 : Si R3 OK, si succ\u00e8s, alors jet de PP pour obtenir un second PoP.

Je trouve cette interpr\u00e9tation un peu bizarre au regard de la suite qui pr\u00e9suppose, dans le combat psionique, que l'attaquant psy a un MA et que le d\u00e9fenseur a un MD. Un d\u00e9fenseur ayant des pouvoirs psychiques sans MD ouvre une br\u00e8che dans le syst\u00e8me. Il n'est pas expliqu\u00e9 comment les MA/MD sont attribu\u00e9s : al\u00e9atoirement (D6 en rejouant le 6) ou s\u00e9quentiellement, en utilisant les lettres, ou par simple choix. Comme la puissance de ces attaques est diverse et non lin\u00e9aire, je pense pas que les lettres soient tr\u00e8s importantes pour les MA. Pour les MD, il y a une certaine progression. Au DM de choisir son mode d'attribution. La liste des modes d'attaque et de d\u00e9fense est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ci-dessous avec leur co\u00fbt en Force Psionique entre parenth\u00e8ses. Modes d'Attaque (MA), toutes classes Modes de D\u00e9fense (MD), toutes classes A. Explosion psionique (20)[x3] F. Esprit vide (1) B. Pouss\u00e9e de l'esprit (10)[x1] G. Bouclier de pens\u00e9e (2) C. Coup de fouet sur l'ego (15)[x3] H. Barri\u00e8res mentales (4) D. Imposition d'identit\u00e9 (10)[x1] I. Forteresse intellectuelle (7) E. \u00c9crasement psychique (25\u2660)[x3] J. Tour de volont\u00e9 de fer (10) \u2660 Si le PJ poss\u00e8de moins de 25 points de FP, il est demand\u00e9 au MJ de \"modifier la probabilit\u00e9 de succ\u00e8s de mani\u00e8re ad hoc \". L'utilisation des MAs peut \u00eatre d\u00e9tect\u00e9e par un PJ ou PNJ ayant des pouvoirs psychiques. Le facteur entre crochets donne le multiplicateur de port\u00e9e du MA dans lequel le PJ ou PNJ peut d\u00e9tecter son usage.
